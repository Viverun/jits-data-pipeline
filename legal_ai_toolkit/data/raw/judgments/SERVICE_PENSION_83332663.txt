List revised. None present for the applicant. However, Shri Ajay Kumar
Rai, learned counsel for the respondents is preset.

2. From the perusal of the order sheets, it is evident that pursuant to
the order of this Tribunal dated 18.07.2025, a registered notice was sent
to the applicant on 23.07.2025. It is further noted by the Registry on
19.08.2025 that the unserved notice was received with the remarks
"incomplete address." Since the matter relates to pay fixation
pertaining to the year 2015, it appears that either the cause of action no
longer survives or the applicant has lost interest in pursuing the case.

3. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal has no option but to
dismiss the Original Application for want of prosecution. Interim order,
if any, stands vacated.

4. All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

ORDER

Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (J)

Heard Shri Ashish Srivastava, learned counsel for the applicant
and Shri Bashist Tiwari, learned counsel for the respondents.

2. Instant Original Application has been filed by the applicant
SUSHIL
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 for the
following main relief(s):-

"i. This Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to direct the respondents to
refix the salary of the late husband of the applicant by giving
benefit of ACP and accordingly the family pension of the
applicant may be revised.

ii. This Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to direct the respondents to
pay the arrears of the fixation with admissible interest thereupon."

3. The brief facts of the case, as per the Original Application, are as
under:-

3.1 The husband of the applicant late Shyam Kishore, entered
railway service in the year 1979-80 as Khalasi under the office of
Respondent No. 2, North Central Railway, Allahabad. In due course, he
was extended the benefit
of CPC
pay scales and was placed in the
grade of Helper Grade-I, where he continued to serve till his demise on
05.01.2011.

3.2 On 01.10.1999, the Railway Board introduced the Assured
Career Progression (ACP) Scheme for its employees, under which
financial upgradations were to be granted on completion of 12 years
and 24 years of regular service. Later on, by circular dated 10.11.2004,
Respondent No. 3 directed all concerned authorities to implement the
scheme and furnish details of eligible employees, clarifying that half of
the casual service together with full service after conferment of
temporary status would count towards the qualifying service for ACP.

3.3 As the said scheme was not being uniformly implemented,
several employees approached this Tribunal by filing O.A. Nos.

398/2008, 107/2009 and 443/2009, which were disposed of with
directions to the respondents to extend ACP benefits in accordance
with the applicable rules and earlier orders.

SUSHIL
KUMAR
3.4 In compliance to the aforesaid order, the respondents granted
SRIVASTAVA
the benefit of ACP to Helper Khalasies by counting half of their casual
service and arrears were also paid.

3.5 The applicant's husband also represented for similar benefit on
12.09.2009. When the same was not considered, he along with other
similarly placed employees filed O.A. No. 379/2010, which was
disposed of on 26.03.2010 with a direction to the respondents to decide
the representation by a reasoned and speaking order.

3.6 The respondents vide order dated 02.07.2010, rejected the
representation of the applicant by observing that earlier
implementations were not in consonance with the Railway Board's
circular dated 17.08.2004. Aggrieved thereby, Shri Shyam Kishore
and others filed O.A. No. 475/2011.

3.7 Unfortunately, during the pendency of the said proceedings,
Shri Shyam Kishore expired on 05.01.2011. Thereafter, the applicant
was sanctioned family pension at the rate of ₹5,480/- per month,
which she is presently drawing.

3.8 The grievance of the applicant is that the pension and family
pension are calculated on the basis of the last pay drawn by the
deceased employee and if her husband had granted the second ACP on
completion of 24 years of service, his pay would have been fixed at a
higher stage, thereby entitling her to enhanced family pension. Hence,
the present Original Application has been filed by the applicant (wife
of deceased employee) seeking extension of ACP benefit and
consequential revision of family pension accordingly.

4. Counter Affidavit has been filed from the side of the respondents
SUSHIL
KUMAR on 14.03.2013 wherein they have denied the claim of the applicant and
SRIVASTAVA
stated that:-

4.1 The husband of the applicant, late Shri Shyam Kishore was
initially appointed as Khalasi and later on promoted as Helper Grade-

I on 01.03.1993 after empanelment on 17.08.1989. He was duly granted

CPC
pay scales during his service and was also extended the benefit of
the first financial upgradation under the ACP Scheme on completion
of 12 years of service.

4.2 Although Shri Shyam Kishore would have become due for the
second financial upgradation under the ACP Scheme on completion of
24 years in 2011, the ACP Scheme had already been replaced by the
Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) Scheme with effect from
01.09.2008 under the 6th
CPC
. Accordingly, he was granted benefits
under the MACP Scheme and no further benefit under the repealed
ACP Scheme can be claimed.

4.3 The service of the deceased employee was duly reckoned in
accordance with Railway Board's directives and all admissible benefits
under the prevailing scheme were already granted to him during his
lifetime. The claim of the applicant that further financial upgradation
or enhanced pension is due, is misconceived.

4.4 The order dated 02.07.2010 passed by the Divisional Personnel
Officer, Allahabad in compliance of this Tribunal's earlier direction in
O.A. No. 379 of 2010, wherein the claim for counting of casual service
towards ACP was specifically rejected as not being in consonance with
the Railway Board's instructions. Hence, the respondents submit that
the Original Application is devoid of merit and liable to be dismissed.

SUSHIL

5. At this stage, learned counsel for the applicant again placed
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA reliance on the impugned order dated 02.07.2010 and stated that in
the second last para of the aforesaid order, the respondents have
themselves recorded that, as far as the MACP Scheme is concerned, in
accordance with the directions dated 01.09.2008 and Railway Board's
letter dated 10.06.2009, the case of financial upgradation of the
petitioner along with similarly situated employees was under

consideration, and if found eligible, financial benefits under the MACP
Scheme would be extended to them.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant contended that the
entitlement of the deceased employee to second financial upgradation
under the ACP Scheme on completion of 24 years of service is evident
from the very scheme itself and denial thereof has resulted in financial
loss to the applicant by way of reduced family pension. He emphasized
that the impugned order dated 02.07.2010 itself acknowledges that
the case of the deceased was under consideration for financial
upgradation under the MACP Scheme as per Railway Board's
instructions dated 01.09.2008 read with letter dated 10.06.2009 and
once such admission was made, the respondents were bound to extend
the benefit rather than indefinitely keeping it pending. It is further
stated that pension is a continuing cause of action and denial of rightful
fixation of pay of the deceased employee directly affects the family
pension of the applicant, thereby necessitating intervention of this
Tribunal.

7. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents argued that the
deceased employee was already extended the benefit of first ACP and
subsequently covered under the MACP Scheme introduced w.e.f.
01.09.2008, under which financial upgradation was duly considered in
accordance with Railway Board's circulars. It is submitted that the

SUSHIL
second ACP benefit claimed by the applicant is untenable as the ACP
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA Scheme itself stood superseded before the deceased could complete 24
years of service and no vested right could accrue in respect of a
repealed scheme. Learned counsel further contended that all
admissible benefits were already granted during the lifetime of the
deceased and the impugned order dated 02.07.2010 only clarified the
legal position as per Railway Board's directives; therefore, the present
claim is misconceived and liable to be dismissed.

8. 8. I have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned
counsel for the parties and perused the pleadings as well as the material
placed on record. The short issue for determination is whether the
deceased employee, late Shri Shyam Kishore, was entitled to
consideration for financial upgradation under the ACP/MACP
Scheme and the consequential revision of family pension payable to
the applicant.

9. It is not in dispute that the husband of the applicant was initially
appointed as Khalasi and later promoted as Helper Grade-I and had
completed more than three decades of service in the Railways. It is also
admitted in the second last para of the impugned order dated
02.07.2010 passed by the Divisional Personnel Officer, Allahabad,
that "as far as the MACP Scheme is concerned, in accordance with the
directions dated 01.09.2008 and Railway Board's letter dated
10.06.2009, the case of financial upgradation of the petitioner along
with similarly situated employees is under consideration and if found
eligible, financial benefits under the MACP Scheme will be extended
to them."

10. Once such an admission has been made in the respondents' own
order, they are duty bound to conclude the process of consideration
instead of keeping the matter pending indefinitely. The Hon'ble
Supreme Court has consistently held that pension and retiral benefits
are a measure of socio-economic security and must be construed
liberally in favour of employees and their dependents [
D.S. Nakara v.
Union of India
, (1983) 1 SCC 305].

It is equally settled that pension and
family pension are continuing causes of action and any denial of
rightful fixation results in recurring financial loss to the beneficiary
[
State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih
, (2015) 4 SCC 334].

11. It is true that after 01.09.2008, the ACP Scheme stood superseded by
the Modified ACP (MACP) Scheme, as explained by the Hon'ble
SUSHIL Supreme Court in
Union of India v. M.V. Mohanan Nair
, (2020) 5 SCC
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

421. However, even under the MACP Scheme, the respondents were
required to examine eligibility and extend financial upgradation
where due. In the present case, the respondents themselves recorded in
the impugned order dated 02.07.2010 that the case of the deceased
employee was "under consideration" for financial upgradation under
the MACP Scheme. Such a stand creates a legitimate expectation in
favour of the employee and, by succession, his widow, which cannot be
left unaddressed.

12. In view of the above discussion, the Original Application is disposed
of with the following directions:

(i) The respondents shall consider and finalize the case of late Shri
Shyam Kishore for grant of financial upgradation under the MACP
Scheme strictly in terms of Railway Board's instructions dated
01.09.2008 read with letter dated 10.06.2009 and other applicable
circulars.

(ii) In the event the deceased employee is found eligible for financial
upgradation under the MACP Scheme, his pay shall be refixed
accordingly, and the family pension of the applicant shall be revised on
that basis.

(iii) Arrears of pay fixation, if any, and arrears of revised family pension
along with admissible allowances shall be released to the applicant
within a period of four months from the date of receipt of a certified
copy of this order.

(iv) If the respondents fail to comply with the aforesaid directions
within the stipulated period, the applicant shall be entitled to simple
interest @ 6% per annum on the arrears from the date they fell due till
actual payment.

13. The Original Application is accordingly disposed of in the above
terms. No order as to costs.

2. Instant Original Application has been filed by the applicant
under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 for the
following main relief(s):-

"i. This Hon'ble Tribunal may be pleased to quash the order of
acceptance of the conditional resignation dated 07.11.2022 of the
applicant and rejection of withdrawal dated 19.08.2024 and also
quash the resolution of penal rent.

ii. This Hon'ble Tribunal may in alternate direct the respondents to
release all the arrears of salary and funds including the retrials
benefit of the applicants forthwith or within a period as stipulated
by this Hon'ble Tribunal. "

3. Learned counsel for the applicant states that the applicant was
serving as Managing Technician under the respondents and while
posted at Allahabad, he was transferred to Durgapur Steel Plant by
order dated 18.02.2019. He was relieved on 07.03.2019. His request for
cancellation of transfer on account of the serious illness of his parents
was, however, not accepted and was rejected on 07.09.2019. The
applicant thereafter did not join at the transferred place.

4. It is further stated by the applicant's counsel that the applicant
being under compulsion, tendered resignation, which was
subsequently accepted on 07.11.2022.

5. The grievance of the applicant is that the resignation was
conditional and, therefore, could not have been accepted in law.
Further, his subsequent request for withdrawal of resignation ought to
have been allowed and that the respondents acted illegally in rejecting
it on 19.08.2024. The applicant also assails the imposition of penal rent
on the ground that he could not vacate the official accommodation at
Allahabad because of the Covid-19 situation and his family
circumstances.

SUSHIL
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA 6. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submit
that transfer is an incidence of service and the plea of medical hardship,
though examined and did not justify exemption. He further submits
that the applicant voluntarily tendered resignation, which was
accepted by the competent authority on 07.11.2022 and that
withdrawal was sought much later i.e. after the resignation had taken
effect. It is also stated that the applicant's continued retention of
government accommodation at Allahabad after his relieving from that
unit was unauthorized, attracting liability of penal rent under the rules.

7. We have considered the rival submissions made by learned
counsel for both the parties and perused the record.

8. Transfer is a normal condition of service and every employee is
required to serve wherever posted. Personal hardship, even when
genuine, does not vest in the employee a right to remain at a particular
station. In this case, the applicant's representation was duly considered
but rejected by the competent authority, which cannot be said to be
arbitrary or unlawful.

9. As regards the resignation, the record clearly shows that it was
tendered by the applicant and accepted on 07.11.2022 by the
Competent Authority wherein it is stated that "Resignation tendered
by Shri Vimlesh Kumar Soni, T/No.490026, SAIL P.No.D001898
Manager (PPCD), is hereby accepted with effect from 12.12.2022
(A/N). This issues with the approval of the Competent Authority." The
contention of the applicant's counsel that it was conditional is not borne
out by evidence. Once resignation is accepted, the relationship of
employer and employee stands severed. The law in this regard is well
settled by the Apex Court in
Union of India v. Gopal Chandra Misra

(
1978) 2 SCC 301, Punjab National Bank v. P.K. Mittal
(1989) 2 SCC
175 and Ravindra Singh Vs. State of M.P. (1995) 3 SLJ 65 (SC), where it
SUSHIL
KUMAR has been held that after acceptance of resignation, an employee cannot,
SRIVASTAVA
as a matter of right, insist upon withdrawal unless the rules specifically
permit. The applicant sought withdrawal in August 2024, nearly two
years after acceptance. By then, the resignation had been fully acted
upon. The rejection of the withdrawal request therefore cannot be
faulted.

10. On the question of penal rent, it is admitted that the applicant
continued to occupy official accommodation at Allahabad despite
having been relieved on 07.03.2019. The rules clearly stipulate that
such retention beyond the permissible period is unauthorized and
attracts penal rent. The plea that Covid-19 prevented compliance does
not carry weight, as the transfer and relieved orders were issued much
before the onset of Covid-19 in 2020. The action of the respondents in
levying penal rent and adjusting it against retiral dues is therefore
perfectly justified under the rules.

11. While this Tribunal is not unmindful of the personal difficulties
faced by the applicant on account of the illness of his parents, service
matters are required to be adjudicated in accordance with established
principles and applicable rules. In the present case, the respondents'
actions are consistent with law, and no arbitrariness or illegality is
demonstrated.

12. For the foregoing reasons, this Tribunal finds no merit in the
present Original Application. Accordingly, the same is dismissed at the
admission stage.

13. There shall be no order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

LARGESS Scheme in place of his father, who was a permanent
employee of the respondents' department. It is stated that in the service
book of the applicant, his date of appointment was erroneously entered
as 26.07.2013. This error was subsequently corrected by the competent
authority vide letter dated 19.01.2024.

5. The grievance of the applicant is that due to the said wrong
entry, his promotions to higher grades carrying Grade Pay ₹1900,
₹2400, and ₹2800 were delayed in comparison to his juniors, who were
appointed later but promoted earlier, thereby drawing higher pay
since 2016. Although his seniority has now been corrected vide
provisional list dated 07.04.2025, his pay fixation and arrears have not
been rectified till date.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that several
SUSHIL
KUMAR
representations have already been made to the authorities, including
SRIVASTAVA
letters dated 20.03.2023, 02.04.2024, and 10.04.2025, but no decision
has been taken on the applicant's claim for refixation of pay and
consequential benefits.

7. Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the present
O.A. raises several disputed questions of fact pertaining to the
applicant's service records, dates of promotion, seniority position and
pay fixation, which require thorough verification from the
departmental records. He therefore seeks some time to obtain
instructions from the department.

8. At this stage, learned counsel for the applicant submits that the
applicant would be satisfied if liberty is granted to him to submit a
comprehensive representation incorporating all his grievances with
supporting documents and if the competent authority amongst the
respondents is directed to consider and decide the same in accordance
with law by passing a reasoned and speaking order within a stipulated
time frame.

9. In view of the above and considering the consensus arrived at
between the parties, the Original Application is disposed of at the
admission stage itself, without expressing any opinion on the merits of
the case, with the direction to the applicant to submit a comprehensive
and consolidated representation setting out all his grievances relating
to his date of appointment, promotions, seniority position, pay fixation,
and consequential monetary benefits, along with all relevant
supporting documents to the competent authority amongst the
respondents. Such representation shall be submitted within two weeks
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

SUSHIL 10. Further, on receipt of the aforesaid representation, the
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA competent authority is directed to decide the same after verifying the
relevant service records and taking into account the applicable rules,
policies, and instructions in force and pass a reasoned and speaking
order on the applicant's representation within a further period of two
months from the date of receipt of such representation. In the event the
applicant is found entitled to any monetary or service-related benefits,
same shall be released to him as early as possible.

11. There shall be no order as to costs.

1. The Union of India through General Manager, Northern
Railway, Ajmeri Gate, New Delhi.

2. Divisional Railway Manager, Northern Railway, Lucknow.

............. Respondents
By Advocate: Shri Saurabh

ORDER

Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (Judicial)

Heard Mr. Mohd Sarwar Khan, learned counsel for the
applicant and Shri Sunil holding brief of Shri Saurabh, learned
counsel for the respondents.

2. The present Original Application has been filed by the
SUSHIL
KUMAR applicant seeking for the following main relief(s):-

SRIVASTAVA
"a. To issue an order or direction in the nature of mandamus
commanding the respondent no.2 to re-fixed the last drawn
salary on the basis of promotion as Sr. Tech (PED) in PB 9300-
34800 with GP 4200/ and give all the post retiral benefits
after re-fixation of the salary and rest past deferential balance
amount between GP 2800 and GP 4200 be also allowed in
favour of the applicant and give the arrears.

II. To issue an order or direction in the nature of mandamus
commanding the respondent no.2 to decide the representation
of the applicant dated 13.1.2020 by reasoned and speaking
order within fortnight."

3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant
was initially appointed as Electrician Khalasi on 19.08.1978 in the
pay scale of ₹196-232 and was subsequently promoted to the post
of Technician-I (Pump Engine Driver) during his service in
Northern Railway. He superannuated from service on 31.03.2013
while drawing a pay of ₹15,110/- in the pay band of ₹5200-
20200 with Grade Pay ₹2800/-.

4. It is further submitted that prior to the retirement of the
applicant a process was initiated for promotion to the post of Senior
Technician (PED) in PB ₹9300-34800 with GP ₹4200/-. The
result of the suitability test was declared on 21.06.2013, after the
applicant had already retired. Further, his name appeared at
Serial No. 5 in the select list, with a remark that he had already
superannuated on 31.03.2013. The final promotion order was
issued on 29.06.2013, promoting those who were still in service,
while excluding the applicant on account of his retirement.

5. The grievance of the applicant is that the delay in issuance
SUSHIL
KUMAR of the promotion order was deliberate and due to administrative
SRIVASTAVA
lapses. He submits that if the respondents had acted in a timely
manner, the promotion could have been granted prior to his
superannuation. He claims that such delay has caused him
significant prejudice, as he has been deprived of financial benefits
that would have accrued from the higher post. He further submits
that he has made repeated representations, including on
19.08.2014 and 13.01.2020 and also approached the authorities
under the
Right to Information Act
on 13.11.2019, but has received
no effective redressal.

6. To the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents submits
that while the applicant's name did appear in the suitability list, he
was not in service on the date of issuance of the promotion order. He
states that mere inclusion in a selection or suitability list does not
confer any vested or enforceable right to promotion, particularly
when the concerned employee has already superannuated. Since
no promotion order was issued in favour of the applicant during his
service tenure, no claim for retrospective promotion or
consequential benefits can be entertained.

7. It is a settled position in service jurisprudence that inclusion
in a suitability or select list does not create an indefeasible right to
promotion. The Apex Court and High Courts have consistently
held that promotion becomes effective only from the date of
issuance of the promotion order and not from the date of inclusion
in the panel or list. Furthermore, once an employee retires from
service, he ceases to have any legal entitlement to be promoted
unless a specific provision or rule permits post-retirement
SUSHIL
KUMAR promotion for the purpose of pension revision, which is not the case
SRIVASTAVA
herein.

8. In the present case, there is no dispute that the applicant
retired from service on 31.03.2013 and that the promotion order
was issued on 29.06.2013. There is also no evidence on record to
show that a promotion order in favour of the applicant was either
approved or kept in abeyance prior to his retirement. In the
absence of any formal promotion order before retirement, no
accrued or vested right can be claimed by the applicant. While the
delay in finalizing the promotion process may be regrettable, such
administrative delays do not entitle a retired employee to claim
promotion retrospectively as a matter of right, particularly when
such promotion carries financial implications. Accordingly, this
Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the reliefs sought by the
applicant are not sustainable either on facts or in law. The Original
Application lacks merit and is liable to be dismissed.

9. In view of the above, the Original Application is dismissed.

10. There shall be no order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

3. The present Original Application has been filed by the applicant,
Shri Abhijeet Kumar, primarily seeking a direction to the respondent-3 for
expeditious disposal of his departmental appeal dated 11.07.2025, which
has been filed against the penalty order dated 07.07.2025 passed by
Respondent No. 4.

4. Learned counsel for the applicant states that the applicant was
appointed as Postal Assistant on 27.04.2009 in Bulandshahar (U.P.) and was
subsequently transferred to Ghazipur Division under Rule 38 of the Postal
Manual Vol. IV. A charge sheet dated 05.05.2025 was issued to him
regarding alleged irregularities during his tenure as Assistant (Stock
Section), Divisional Office, Ghazipur, for the period 28.08.2016 to
04.11.2018.

5. The grievance of the applicant is that during the reply period, he was
medically unfit due to spinal injury and was advised bed rest. Despite this,
the penalty order dated 07.07.2025 was passed without granting him a
opportunity to defend. Learned counsel for the applicant further submits
that the applicant has already preferred a departmental appeal dated
11.07.2025 before Respondent No. 3 against the aforesaid penalty order but
the same has not yet been decided. Therefore, he restricts his prayer and
confines his relief to a direction for early disposal of the said appeal in
accordance with law.

6. To the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents, Shri Chakrapani
Vatsyayan, submits that the penalty order dated 07.07.2025 was passed in
accordance with the provisions of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965, after due
service of the charge sheet upon the applicant and granting him an
opportunity to submit his reply. He further submits that the departmental
appeal dated 11.07.2025 filed by the applicant is under active consideration
SUSHIL and will be decided as per rules and procedure.
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

7. In view of the limited nature of relief sought by the applicant and
considering the assurance given on behalf of the respondents that the
departmental appeal dated 11.07.2025 is under active consideration, this
Tribunal deems it appropriate to dispose of the present Original Application
with a direction to the competent authority, i.e., Respondent No. 3, to
consider and decide the applicant's pending departmental appeal dated
11.07.2025 strictly in accordance with law and pass a reasoned and speaking
order within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of a certified
copy of this order.

8. It is made clear that this Tribunal has not expressed any opinion on
the merits of the case.

9. With the above direction, the Original Application stands disposed
of. No order as to costs.

ORDER

Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (Judicial)

Heard Shri Shashank Tripathi, learned counsel for the applicant and
Shri Anil Kumar, learned counsel for the respondents.

2. Instant Misc. Application has been filed by the applicant(s) seeking
SUSHIL
KUMAR
condonation of delay in filing the accompanying Original Application
SRIVASTAVA
registered as Diary No. 862/2025.

3. The main relief sought by the applicant in the Original Application
is to quash the removal order dated 30.06.2017 passed against the
applicant's husband, late Virendra Kumar and to treat him in service till his
death on 21.08.2022, along with a prayer for payment of arrears of salary,
family pension, and other consequential benefits.

4. It is stated by learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant is a
poor widow and had no knowledge of the removal order passed against her
husband during his lifetime. It is contended that the applicant came to know
about the impugned order only recently and upon legal advice, filed the
present application. It is submitted that the delay is neither deliberate nor
intentional but occurred due to circumstances beyond the control of the
applicant.

5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents has strongly
opposed the delay condonation application by filing objection dated
05.04.2025. It has been submitted that the removal order dated 30.06.2017
was passed after following due process of law and was duly served upon the
applicant's husband. The delinquent employee never challenged the order
during his lifetime nor submitted any representation or objection. The
present application, filed after more than seven and a half years, is not
maintainable and is liable to be dismissed as being hopelessly barred by
time. Reliance is placed on several decisions of the Apex Court, including

Union of India v. Harnam Singh, Capt
.

Harish Uppal v. Union of India
and

Bhoop Singh v. Union of India
, to contend that inordinate and unexplained
delay is a valid ground to deny relief.

6. We have carefully considered the rival submissions and perused the
record. It is not in dispute that the removal order dated 30.06.2017 was
passed against the applicant's husband and remained unchallenged
throughout his lifetime. The applicant has not produced any cogent material
or specific dates to substantiate the plea that she became aware of the said
SUSHIL
KUMAR order only recently. The explanation offered for the delay is vague, general,
SRIVASTAVA
and does not satisfy the test of "sufficient cause" as required under
Section
21(3)
of the Administrative Tribunals Act.

7. The law on delay and limitation is well settled. Mere filing of
representations or ignorance of an order cannot be a ground for condonation
of delay, particularly when the delay is of more than seven years. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Bhoop Singh
(supra) and
Harish Uppal
(supra)
has categorically held that inordinate and unexplained delay is sufficient to
deny relief regardless of the merits of the case.

8. In the present case, the applicant has failed to explain each day's
delay or demonstrate any justifiable cause for approaching the Tribunal at
such a belated stage. The inaction of the applicant and her late husband over
such an extended period reflects complete laches and negligence.

9. In view of the above, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the
delay in filing the Original Application is inordinate and not satisfactorily
explained. Accordingly, the Miscellaneous Application for condonation of
delay is rejected. As a result, the Dy. No.862/2025 (Original Application)
also stands dismissed as barred by limitation.

10. No order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

SRIVASTAVA

3. The present Original Application has been filed by the applicant
seeking for the following main relief(s):-

"a. to issue a direction to the respondent No.3 to fix the salary of the
applicant with effect from01.01.2006 in the pay band of
Rs.9870+Rs.4200 as grade pay (Rs.14070) according to Rule 7(ii)
of the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 and
according to the order dated 10.02.2009 passed by the South -
East Railway, Kharagpur with all consequential benefits.

b. To issue a directing to the respondent No.3 to pay the entire arrears
of salary to the applicant after fixation of his pay with effect from
01.01.2006 on pay band of Rs.9870+ Rs.4200/- as grade pay (total
Rs.14070/-) along with 10% interest per annum from 01.01.2006
till the date of actual payment."

4. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant was
appointed as a Primary School Teacher under the North-East Railway on
28.02.2001 in the pre-revised pay scale of Rs. 4500-7000 and was drawing
a basic pay of Rs. 5000/- as on 01.01.2006. He further submitted that upon
implementation of the 6th Central Pay Commission recommendations and
issuance of the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008, Rule 7(ii)
of the said Rules provided for the grant of an additional increment in cases
where pay bunching occurred. He submits that Primary School Teachers
under the South-East Railway, who were similarly placed and drawing the
same basic pay as the applicant, were extended the benefit of bunching and
had their pay fixed at Rs. 9870/- in Pay Band-2 with a Grade Pay of Rs.
4200/-, totaling Rs. 14,070/- with effect from 01.01.2006.

5. The grievance of the applicant is that despite being identically
situated, the applicant was denied the same benefit by the respondents
without any valid justification. In this regard, the applicant submitted a
detailed representation dated 12.08.2013 to Respondent No. 3 seeking
parity but no decision has been communicated to him till date.

6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted
SUSHIL that the applicant's pay was correctly fixed in accordance with the
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA provisions of the Central Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 and the
fitment tables issued by the Railway Board. It is contended that the
applicant, who was drawing a basic pay of Rs.5000/- as on 01.01.2006 is
rightly placed in the revised pay band of Rs. 9300-34800 with a Grade Pay
of Rs. 4200/-, which corresponds to his pre-revised basic pay as per the
official fitment chart. Therefore, the fixation of the applicant's pay at Rs.
9300/- + GP Rs. 4200/- is as per the applicable rules and there is no error
or irregularity in the matter.

7. He further submitted that the benefit of bunching under Rule 7(ii) of
the Revised Pay Rules, 2008 is not to be granted automatically, but only
when the specific conditions laid down therein are fulfilled. The respondents,
after receiving various representations on similar issues, examined the
matter in consultation with the Accounts Department and concluded that
the bunching benefit was not applicable in the applicant's case. This decision
was duly communicated to the concerned authorities vide letter dated
25.04.2012.

8. At this stage, learned counsel for the applicant placed reliance on the
order dated 28.02.2013 passed by the Jabalpur Bench of this Tribunal in
O.A. No. 141/2012 (
S.C. Sharma vs. Union of India & Others
) and submitted
that an identical issue has already been decided in the said case. He further
stated that the applicant would be satisfied if a direction is issued to
respondent No. 3 to decide the applicant's pending representation dated
12.08.2013 in light of the aforesaid order passed by the Jabalpur Bench.

9. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material
available on record. The core grievance of the applicant relates to non-
extension of the benefit of bunching under Rule 7(ii) of the Central Civil
Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008, which, according to the applicant, has
been granted to similarly situated Primary School Teachers under the
South-East Railway, Kharagpur. It is not in dispute that the applicant
SUSHIL submitted a detailed representation dated 12.08.2013 to Respondent No.3
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA seeking similar treatment, but no reasoned or speaking order has been
passed on the said representation till date.

10. In service jurisprudence, particularly where financial entitlements
are involved, a reasoned decision by the competent authority is not only
desirable but legally necessary. While this Tribunal does not propose to go
into the merits of the applicant's claim at this stage, in the interest of justice,
we are of the opinion that the applicant's representation deserves to be
considered afresh by the competent authority in accordance with law.

11. Accordingly, this Original Application is disposed of with a direction
to Respondent No.3 to consider and decide the applicant's representation
dated 12.08.2013 by passing a reasoned and speaking order, keeping in view
the provisions of Rule 7(ii) of the CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008, the
Railway Board's instructions and the order dated 28.02.2013 passed by the
Jabalpur Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 141/2012 (
S.C. Sharma vs. Union
of India & Ors
), within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a
certified copy of this order.

12. It is made clear that this Tribunal has not expressed any opinion on
the merits of the case.

13. There shall be no order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

ORDER
Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (Judicial)
Heard S.K Singh Vashisth, learned counsel for the applicant and
Shri Chakrapani Vatsyayan, learned counsel for the respondents.

SUSHIL 2. With the consent of the learned counsel for both parties, the
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA matter is being heard and decided finally at the admission stage itself.

3. The present Original Application has been filed by the
applicant challenging the impugned movement order dated
07.05.2025 issued by the respondents whereby he has been directed to
report at CWE, Tezpur pursuant to his promotion to the post of
Administrative Officer-II (AO-II) vide order dated 27.02.2025. The
applicant has also prayed for a direction to the respondents to consider
his representations for a change of posting to Prayagraj, in view of the
available and anticipated vacancies.

4. The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
applicant was initially appointed as LDC on 26.12.1997, promoted to
UDC on 23.03.2005 and thereafter as Office Superintendent (AAO)
on 02.03.2020. On 27.02.2025, he is promoted as AO-II and
transferred to CWE, Tezpur.

5. Aggrieved by the place of posting, the applicant submitted
several representations dated 18.03.2025, 29.04.2025, 02.05.2025,
06.05.2025 and 09.05.2025 requesting for a change of posting to HQ
CWE Prayagraj, HQ CE (AF) Prayagraj or HQ CWE Bamrauli,
mentioning his personal hardship and availability of vacant posts at
those stations.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant further submits when the
aforesaid representations have not been responded by the respondents
authorities, the applicant again moved a representation on 06.05.2025
along with forgo certificate indicating his decision to forgo the
promotion in case the transfer to Tezpur is not withdrawn. However, the
respondents in spite of taking any decision of the representations of the
applicant proceeded to issue the movement order dated 07.05.2025,
SUSHIL compelling him to join at Tezpur.
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

7. By concluding his submission, learned counsel for the applicant
submitted that the action of the respondents in ignoring the applicant's
request and compelling him to proceed to Tezpur, despite his forgoing
the promotion, is arbitrary and discriminatory. A specific instance of
one Smt. Sunita Devi has been cited who, despite being senior, has
served and continued to serve her entire tenure at Prayagraj and has
also been retained there upon her promotion, thereby pointing to
discriminatory treatment.

8. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the
posting on promotion is subject to administrative requirements and
exigencies of service. The applicant has been promoted on merit and the
posting to Tezpur was made considering organizational needs. It is
further contended that the issuance of a forgo certificate does not
automatically invalidate the movement order unless the competent
authority formally accepts the forgo request and cancels the promotion.

9. We have considered the rival submissions made by learned
counsel for the parties and perused the material available on record.

10. From the records and submissions of the learned counsel for the
parties, it is evident that the applicant has made multiple
representations citing personal hardship and availability of vacancies
at Prayagraj. He has also submitted a forgo certificate dated
06.05.2025, clearly expressing his unwillingness to accept the
promotion if the posting to Tezpur is not reconsidered. However, it
appears that the respondents have not passed any reasoned or speaking
order on these representations, nor have they clarified the status of the
forgo request.

SUSHIL
KUMAR 11. While this Tribunal agrees that postings on promotion fall within
SRIVASTAVA
the realm of administrative discretion, such discretion must be
exercised in a fair, transparent and non-arbitrary manner. It is well
settled that administrative authorities are bound to consider and
respond to representations made by employees, especially when such
requests are grounded in personal hardship and backed by the
existence of vacancies.

12. In view of the above, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate at
this stage to interfere with the movement order directly. However, the
Tribunal is of the opinion that the applicant's grievance warrants
consideration by the competent authority. Accordingly, The Original
Application is disposed of with a direction to the applicant to file a
fresh representation raising his grievance along with forgo certificate
within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy
of this order. On receipt of such representation the Competent
Authority among the respondents shall consider and decide the same
in accordance with the applicable rules and pass a reasoned and
speaking order within four weeks.

13. There shall be no order as to costs.

Heard Shri Akshya Mishra, learned counsel for the applicant
SUSHIL
KUMAR and Shri Shree Prakash Rai, learned counsel for the respondents and
SRIVASTAVA
perused the record.

2. Present Original Application has been filed by the applicant
under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 seeking
appointment in favour of applicant no.2, being the nominee of the
deceased son of applicant no.1, who died in the train accident involving
Train No. 12311 (Howrah-Delhi Kalka Mail) on 10.07.2011 near Malwan
Railway Station. The applicant has relied upon the Railway Board's
letter dated 19.08.2011, which indicated that one member of each
deceased passenger's family would be considered for Group-D
employment in the Indian Railways.

3. It is not in dispute that the applicant was paid compensation of
Rs. 5,00,000/- in 2019 and subsequently received the enhanced
compensation of Rs. 8,00,000/- pursuant to the amended Railway
Accidents and Untoward Incidents (Compensation) Rules, 1990, upon
the direction of the Railway Claims Tribunal.

4. The grievance of the applicant is that although he has submitted
a representation on 16.12.2024 requesting for appointment to
applicant No.2 in accordance with the Railway Board's letter dated
19.08.2011, but the respondents neither taken any action nor
communicated any decision on the said representation.

5. The respondents submit that the applicant's claim for
appointment is barred by excessive delay, as the representation was
made only on 16.12.2024, more than thirteen years after the accident in
2011 and several years after the DNA identification in 2017. The
respondents further contend that no sufficient explanation has been
offered for the delay and therefore, the claim is not maintainable and
SUSHIL liable to be rejected.

KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

6. After hearing the learned counsel for both parties and upon a
careful perusal of the material available on record, this Tribunal is of
the considered view that the applicant has approached the
respondents with the request for engagement/appointment after an
inordinate and unexplained delay of more than thirteen years from the
date of the unfortunate train accident on 10.07.2011. Even after the
conclusive DNA identification in 2017, the applicant waited until
16.12.2024 to submit his representation. The Railway Board's letter
dated 19.08.2011, while indicative of a welfare measure to assist
families of deceased passengers, does not confer an unconditional or
perpetual right to seek appointment. The underlying objective of such
schemes is to provide timely support to the dependents of the deceased
and prolonged delay without reasonable justification defeats this
purpose.

7. In view of the above, we finds no merit in the claim of the
applicants. The applicants failed to approach the competent authority
within a reasonable period and has not explained the cause of such
extraordinary delay. As a result, the prayer for
engagement/appointment does not warrant any indulgence.
Accordingly, the Original Application is dismissed.

8. There shall be no order as to costs.

By Advocate: Smt. Seema Srivastava
ORDER
Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (Judicial)
Heard Shri Dinesh Chandra Yadav, learned counsel for the
applicant and Smt. Seema Srivastava, learned counsel for the
respondents.

2. Instant Misc. Application has been filed by the applicant(s)
seeking condonation of delay in filing the accompanying Original
Application registered as Diary No. 2717/2025. The delay has been
sought to be condoned on the grounds, inter alia, that the applicants
SUSHIL
KUMAR
were contract labourers working as parcel-porters under the
SRIVASTAVA
supervision of the Railway authorities for several years and had
participated in the screening process conducted on 04.04.2013 in
compliance with the Hon'ble Supreme Court's judgment dated
17.11.2009 and subsequent order dated 15.02.2013 in Writ Petition
(Civil) No. 433/1998 and connected matters.

3. It has been averred that despite participating in the said
screening, the results were not declared and the applicants kept
making oral and written representations from the year 2014 till 2022.
Further, two more representations were submitted in 2023 and 2024
respectively. It is on the basis of these later representations that the
applicants claim the cause of action is continuing and that the Original
Application filed in February 2025 is within time.

4. We have carefully considered the submissions made by leaned
counsel for both the parties and perused the record. The screening in
question was held on 04.04.2013. Thereafter, the applicants claim to
have submitted various representations over the years, with the last
ones dated 20.11.2023 and 17.10.2024. However, the cause of action, if
any, arose when the result of the screening was allegedly not declared
shortly after April 2013 and certainly not later than 2014, when the
applicants themselves claim to have begun pursuing the matter with
the authorities.

5. The law is well settled that mere submission of representations
does not extend the period of limitation unless the delay is properly
explained and is supported by cogent reasons. Repeated
representations, without any action from the respondents or without
any substantive response, cannot revive a stale cause of action. The
applicants have not demonstrated sufficient cause or any compelling
SUSHIL
KUMAR circumstances justifying the long delay of over 11 years from the date of
SRIVASTAVA
screening.

6. The Apex Court in the case of
Union of India v. M.K. Sarkar
,
(2010) 2 SCC 59 and several other cases has clearly held that stale
claims cannot be entertained merely because representations have
been filed from time to time.

7. The applicants have also pleaded lack of knowledge regarding
limitation provisions, but ignorance of law is no excuse and cannot be a
ground for condonation of such an inordinate delay.

8. In view of the above, this Tribunal is not satisfied that sufficient
cause has been made out for condonation of delay. Accordingly, The
Misc. Application for condonation of delay is dismissed. Resultantly,
the Original Application (Dy. No.2717/2025) is also rejected as
barred by limitation.

9. No order as to costs.

10. All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

Heard Shri Abhishek Rai, learned counsel for the applicant and
Shri Chakrapani Vatsyayan, learned counsel for the respondents.

SUSHIL 2. Present Original Application has been filed by the applicant
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 seeking for
the following main relief(s):-

"A. This Hon'ble Tribunal may graciously be pleased to set
aside/quash the impugned order dated 18/26.07.2024
passed by the Director General (News) Prasar Bharti India's
Public Service Broadcaster Directorate General Akashwani
Vigilance Section.

B. This Hon'ble Tribunal may graciously be pleased to direct the
opposite party to conclude and decide the disciplinary
proceeding pursuant to the office memorandum dated
10.08.2017 within period stipulated by this Hon'ble Tribunal.

C. This Hon'ble Tribunal may graciously be pleased to direct the
opposite party to open the seal cover result of the post
Accountant to the Administrative Officer (AO). Pursuant to
the DPC for promotion to the post of Administrative Officer
for the vacancy in the year 2022 & 2023.

D. This Hon'ble Tribunal may graciously be pleased to direct the
opposite party to accord the notional promotion over the post
of Administrative Officer from the date his juniors have
already been promoted."

3. At the very outset, learned counsel for the applicant drew the
attention of this Tribunal towards Para-7 of the Counter Reply in which
it is mentioned that:-

"7. That the inquiry proceedings have been completed and
the IO in his report dated 18.08.2024 has concluded that the
charges are not proved. The report has been accepted by the
Disciplinary Authority and procedural requirement under Rule
14 and 15 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 are completed.
However, due to various with the 1st sage advice of CVC, the case
was referred to the commission for its 2nd stage advice. CVC vide
OM dated 25.02.2025 has agreed with the recommendations of
the Disciplinary Authority and advice that the applicant may
be exonerated. Accordingly, the case is present under process for
issue necessary orders. There has been no deliberate attempt to
delay or prolong the case against the applicant. However, due
to the facts and circumstances stated above, the disciplinary case
against the applicant could not be concluded as on date. With
regard to promotion of the applicant, the matter is being
handled as per extend guidelines and the applicant will be
SUSHIL entitled to all promotional benefits after the conclusion of his
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
disciplinary case. "

4. By relying the aforesaid facts, learned counsel for the applicant
submits that respondents have admitted that the disciplinary
proceedings initiated against the applicant have been concluded. The
Inquiry Officer has exonerated the applicant of all charges, and the
report has been accepted by the Disciplinary Authority. Furthermore,
the Central Vigilance Commission, in its second stage advice dated
25.02.2025, has also concurred with the findings and recommended
exoneration.

5. Leaned counsel for the applicant further submits that in view of
the admitted facts, the reliefs sought at Para A (quashing of the
impugned charge memo) and Para B (expeditious conclusion of the
disciplinary proceedings) have become infructuous. However, he
requested the Tribunal to dispose of the OA by issuing an appropriate
directions for opening the sealed cover relating to the applicant's
promotion to the post of Administrative Officer for the vacancy years
2022 and 2023 and to consider him for notional promotion from the
date on which his juniors were promoted, as delay in issuing the final
exoneration order is causing continuing prejudice to the applicant's
career progression and promotional benefits.

6. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents
reiterates the position taken in the counter affidavit and submits that
the process for issuance of final exoneration order is underway and
necessary action in relation to the sealed cover and promotional
consideration shall be undertaken in due course in accordance with
law.

7. We have considered the rival submissions made by learned
counsel for both the parties and perused the material available on
record particularly Para-7 of the Counter Affidavit.

SUSHIL 8. It is evident from the Counter Affidavit that the disciplinary
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA proceedings against the applicant have concluded with the charges
held as not proved by the Inquiry Officer and the findings accepted by
the Disciplinary Authority. The CVC has also concurred with the
recommendation for exoneration and the issuance of the final order is
stated to be under process.

9. In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that Reliefs
A and B, as prayed for in the Original Application, have become
infructuous. However, since the final exoneration order is yet to be
issued and the sealed cover procedure in respect of the applicant's
promotion to the post of Administrative Officer for the vacancy years
2022 and 2023 is pending conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings,
appropriate directions are warranted to safeguard the applicant's
promotional rights.

10. Accordingly, the Original Application is disposed of with the
directions to the respondents to issue the final exoneration order of the
applicant within four weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy
of this order. Thereafter, within the next eight weeks, they shall open
the sealed cover and consider the applicant's promotion to the post of
Administrative Officer for the vacancy years 2022 and 2023. If found
fit by the DPC, he shall be granted notional promotion from the date his
immediate junior was promoted, with consequential benefits as per
rules, excluding arrears of salary.

11. No order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of.

Subhodh Ranjan Joharia 66 years S/o Late Brahm Swaroop Johari, 246, Near
Chandu Pan Bhandar, Moradabad Road, Police Station Katghar, District
Moradabad.

...........Applicant
By Advocate: Shri Rakesh Kumar Verma
Versus

1. Union of India through the Secretary Ministry of
Railway,Baroda House, New Delhi.

2. Divisional Railway Manager, Northern Railway, D.R.M. Office,
Moradabad,

3. Divisional Finance Manager, Northern Railway, Moradabad.

4. Assistant Section Officer, Northern Railway, Moradabad.

............. Respondents
By Advocate: Shri Chakrapani Vatsyayan

ORDER

Heard Shri Dharmendra Tiwari holding brief of Shri Rakesh
Kumar Verma, learned counsel for the applicant and Shri Chakrapani
Vatsyayan, learned counsel for the respondents.

SUSHIL 2. With the consent of the learned counsel for both parties, the
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA matter is being heard and decided finally at the admission stage itself.

3. The Applicant, a retired employee of the Northern Railway, has
approached this Tribunal under
Section 19
of the Administrative
Tribunals Act, 1985, seeking redressal of his grievance regarding
deductions made from his retirement benefits including gratuity and
other admissible dues amounting to Rs. 2,21,575/-. The Applicant
retired from the post of Chief Train Ticket Inspector (CTTI) from
Northern Railway, Moradabad Division on 31.01.2019.

4. The case of the applicant is that after issuance of the retirement
letter the Respondent No. 2 (Divisional Railway Manager, Moradabad)
prepared the settlement dues on 30.01.2019 which were later
processed by Respondent No. 3 (Divisional Finance Manager) through
issuance of the Pension Payment Order dated 21.10.2019/08.11.2019.

5. Learned counsel for the applicants contends that during this
process, several deductions were made from his retirement dues
without any show-cause notice, inquiry or opportunity of hearing,
which is against the principles of natural justice and established legal
norms.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant further submits that
aggrieved by such deductions, the Applicant submitted his first
detailed representation/objection on 25.02.2019 before the
Respondent No. 2. However, no action was taken. Thereafter, the
Applicant further submitted representations on 10.07.2019,
29.07.2019 and ultimately a reminder dated 02.01.2024 requesting
for reconsideration of the deductions and re-fixation of his pension but
the respondents have not taken any decision on the matter till date.

7. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that it is a settled
SUSHIL principle of law that any deduction from terminal benefits of a
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA Government Servant cannot be made without due process of law and
without giving the concerned employee a reasonable opportunity of
being heard. The action of the Respondents in withholding a substantial
amount from the Applicant's gratuity and other dues without assigning
any reason or issuing any communication is arbitrary, non-transparent
and not in conformity with the principles of natural justice.

8. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the
deductions from the Applicant's retirement dues were made as per
rules to recover pending liabilities, and the pension was correctly fixed
based on service records.

9. Having considered the submissions made by the learned counsel
for both the parties and upon perusal of the record, the Tribunal is of the
view that ends of justice would be met by directing the Respondents to
examine and decide the pending representations of the Applicant in a
time-bound manner. Accordingly, the Original Application is
disposed of with the direction to Competent Authority among the
respondents to consider and decide the Applicant's representation
dated 29.07.2019 in accordance with law and relevant rules governing
pensionary and retirement benefits and pass a reasoned and speaking
order within a period of eight (08) weeks from the date of receipt of a
copy of this order. The decision taken shall be communicated to the
Applicant forthwith.

10. It is made clear that this Tribunal has not expressed any opinion
on the merits of the case.

11. With the above directions, the Original Application stands
disposed of. No order as to costs.

ORDER

Heard Shri S.J. Ishtiaque, learned counsel for the applicants and
Shri Mahendra Prasad Mishra, learned counsel for the respondents.
Since, the matter is not admitted therefore with the consent of learned
counsel for both the parties, the OA is heard and decided finally at this
stage.

2. The applicants have filed this Original Application under

Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 seeking to quash
the order dated 28.05.2022 passed by Respondent- 6. They also seek
directions to include HRA, TA and SFA in overtime allowance
calculations, pay arrears with interest and consider his representations
dated 15.03.2021, 25.06.2021, 20.09.2021 and 24.12.2023 in light of
the Madras High Court judgment followed by Tribunals.

3. The facts of the case, in brief, are as follows:-

3.1 The applicants in this case are members of a recognized
employee association. They are either currently working in or have
retired from the Field Gun Factory, Kanpur. The factory was placed
under the administrative control of CMD, Advanced Weapons &
Equipment India Limited through a government notification issued on
01.10.2021.

3.1 The applicants were receiving Overtime Allowance (OTA)
SUSHIL whenever they worked beyond their normal weekly duty of 44.75
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA hours. Earlier, the calculation of OTA included various allowances such
as House Rent Allowance (HRA), City Compensatory Allowance,
Transport Allowance and Small Family Allowance, as per the
Factories
Act, 1948
. However, through a memorandum dated 26.06.2009, the
Respondent No.1 decided to exclude certain allowances (HRA,
Transport Allowance and Small Family Allowance) from OTA
calculation, effective from 01.01.2006.

3.2 Previously, the applicants had filed OA No.857/2021 seeking
directions to extend the benefit of Overtime Allowance (OTA) by
including HRA, TA, and SFA from 01.01.2006 based on the Madras
High Court's order dated 30.11.2011 in Writ Petition No. 609/2011 and
similar orders passed by different Benches of this Tribunal and this
Tribunal vide order dated 22.10.2021, directing Respondent-6 to
decide the applicant's pending representation in light of the Madras
High Court's judgment and the orders of various Benches of this
Tribunal. However, the said representation of the applicants was
rejected vide order dated 28.05.2022, which is challenged in the
present case.

4. Respondents have filed Counter Affidavit on 05.04.2024 and
have denied claim of the applicant by stating that:

4.1 The applicant has relied on various judgments passed by
different High Courts and Tribunals. However, it is submitted that
every case is decided on its own merits and general reliance on such
judgments does not apply to the applicant's case. Citing multiple cases
without demonstrating their direct applicability is misleading and
should not be considered.

SUSHIL
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA 4.2 The respondents have acted in strict compliance with the order
dated 22.10.2021 passed by this Tribunal in OA No. 857/2021. A
detailed speaking order was passed on 28.05.2022, following an
earlier speaking order dated 18.01.2022. The contempt petition filed by
the applicant regarding non-compliance was also dismissed by this
Tribunal on 12.04.2023, holding that the order had been substantively
complied with.

4.3 The issue raised by the applicant relates to Field Gun Factory,
which now falls under Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Ltd.
The applicant has compared it with orders issued for a different factory,
Ordnance Parachute Factory, which is under another corporation.
Since both belong to separate entities, orders passed for one cannot be
applied to the other. Therefore, the Original Application is liable to be
dismissed.

5. Rejoinder Affidavit has also been filed by the applicants'
counsel in which he has denied the averments of the respondents'
counsel and reiterated the facts of the Original Application.

6. The applicants' counsel submits that the exclusion of HRA, TA,
and SFA from Overtime Allowance (OTA) calculations is contrary to

Section 59(2)
of the Factories Act, 1948. They rely on the Madras High
Court's judgment, which held that all allowances must be included in
OTA calculations. Several Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)
Benches, including those in Kolkata, Hyderabad, and New Delhi, have
also directed the inclusion of these allowances in OTA. The applicants
further submit that the Ministry of Defence has implemented these
orders for similarly placed employees and therefore, they are also
entitled to the same benefits.

SUSHIL
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA 6.1 It is also submitted by the applicants' counsel that the case of the
applicant is identical to previous cases where orders were passed in
favor of employees and the Tribunal should ensure uniform application
of the law. The respondents have arbitrarily rejected their claim
without proper reasoning, despite clear judicial precedents. The
applicants request that the Tribunal quash the impugned order dated
28.05.2022 and direct the respondents to grant them OTA benefits
with arrears and interest, as given to similarly placed employees.

7. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the
applicants cannot claim benefits solely based on judgments passed in
other cases. Each case is decided on its own facts and the applicants
have not shown how those judgments directly apply to their situation.
The Tribunal had already directed the respondents to decide the
applicants' representation, which was done through a detailed
speaking order on 28.05.2022. Since the order was properly reasoned
and in compliance with the Tribunal's earlier directions, there is no basis
for interfering with it.

7.1 The respondents further contend that the applicants are
comparing their case with employees from a different factory under
another corporation, which is not valid. The Field Gun Factory, Kanpur,
where the applicants worked now falls under Advanced Weapons and
Equipment India Ltd., while the cited cases involved a different entity.
Therefore, the applicants cannot demand the same benefits based on
orders passed for another factory. Since the issue has already been
considered and decided, the present Original Application should be
dismissed.

8. I have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel

SUSHIL
for both the parties and perused the pleadings available on record.
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

9. It is evident from the record that the applicants seek inclusion of
HRA, TA, and SFA in the calculation of Overtime Allowance (OTA),
relying on various judicial pronouncements including the judgment of
the Madras High Court. The respondents, on the other hand, contend
that the exclusion of these allowances from OTA calculation is based
on a policy decision and that the applicants' case is distinguishable
from those previously decided.

10. It is also bring from the record that various Employee
Associations and Unions objected to this change issued vide
memorandum dated 26.09.2009 and filed representations before the
authorities. Some unions had also approached judicial forums. One of
the Employee Union namely Heavy Vehicles Factory Employees filed
OA No. 1144 of 2009 before the Central Administrative Tribunal
(CAT), Chennai Bench and the Tribunal vide order dated 24.12.2010
dismissed the OA.

11. The union then challenged the Tribunal's decision in the Madras
High Court and the Madras High Court in Writ Petition Nos.
609/2011, 1276/2011, 1466/2011, 1980/2011 to 1982/2011,
9076/2011, and 21035/2011 vide order dated 30.11.2011 held that "the
exclusion of allowances was not in accordance with
Section 59(2)
of the
Factories Act, 1948." The High Court set aside the Tribunal's order and
directed that all allowances should be included in OTA calculations.

12. The respondents challenged the Madras High Court judgment in
the Apex Court in SLP No. 12845-12852 of 2012 and the Apex Court
admitted the appeal but did not grant a stay order meaning the Madras
High Court's ruling had to be implemented until a final decision was

SUSHIL
made.

KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA

13. Based on this, several Benches of this Tribunal including
Hyderabad Bench in OA Nos. 18/2018 and 20/2018, Kolkata Bench
in OA No. 1523/2019 and Principal Bench New Delhi in OA
No.650/2016 passed similar orders directing the inclusion of
allowances in OTA calculations.

14. It is also notice that the Kolkata Bench of this Tribunal in OA No.
1523 of 2019 directed the applicants to submit representations with an
undertaking that any payment received would be subject to the
outcome of the pending Supreme Court case. Similarly, in OA No. 705
of 2020 and OA No. 139 of 2021, the Kolkata Bench passed an order in
favor of employees, directing the respondents to grant the same benefits
as other Tribunal benches and the Madras High Court.

15. Thereafter, the Ministry of Defence implemented the Calcutta
Bench's order on 17.03.2021 and the Controller of Finance and
Accounts (Factories), Bengal Group ordered the payment of OTA
arrears by 31.08.2021.

16. Following the aforesaid orders passed by the Madras High Court
ad well as Several Bench of this Tribunal, the Allahabad Bench of this
Tribunal has also passed an order dated 14.09.2021 in OA
No.698/2021 in favor of employees directing the respondents to issue
a reasoned order considering past judgments and grant similar benefits
if the case facts were identical.

17. In view of the discussion made above, it is observed that the issue
in question has already been decided by various Benches of this
Tribunal including the Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Principal
Benches, as well as by the Madras High Court in Writ Petition No.
SUSHIL
KUMAR 609/2011 and connected matters. The Madras High Court held that
SRIVASTAVA
the exclusion of these allowances was not in accordance with
Section
59(2)
of the Factories Act, 1948 and directed that all allowances should
be included in OTA calculations. The respondents challenged
the said
judgment
before the Supreme Court in SLP No. 12845-12852 of 2012,
which was admitted but no stay was granted, meaning the Madras High
Court's ruling remains in operation.

18. Following the orders of the Madras High Court and various
Benches of this Tribunal, the Ministry of Defence implemented the
order of the Kolkata Bench and directed the payment of OTA arrears.

19. In view of the above and considering that the respondents have
already implemented similar orders passed by other Benches, the
present OA deserves to be allowed in terms of those decisions.

20. Accordingly, the Original Application is allowed, and the
impugned order dated 28.05.2021, denying the claim of the applicants,
is set aside. The respondents are directed to reconsider the applicants'
claim for inclusion of HRA, TA, and SFA in OTA calculations in
accordance with the orders passed by various Benches of this Tribunal
as well as the Madras High Court. The respondents shall pass a reasoned
order within three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of
this order. If the applicants are found eligible for the same benefit, the
respondents shall extend the benefit to them accordingly. However,
any payment made to the applicants shall be subject to the final
outcome of the SLP No.12845-12852 of 2012 pending before the Apex
Court.

21. There shall be no order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of. The
registry will take appropriate action in this regard for removing the

SUSHIL
M.As.

2. Instant Original Application has been filed by the applicant
under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 seeking for
a direction to the Respondent-4 to allow the applicant to continuously
discharge her services under the respondents and pay her salary time
to time.

3. The brief facts of the case as stated in the Original Application
are as under:-

3.1 The applicant, a divorced woman was engaged as a casual
laborer on 31.05.2017 under the respondents. She was entrusted with
duties such as serving tea, shifting files, photocopying and other clerical
tasks. She continued working until 17.04.2023, when her services were
discontinued by Respondent- 5.

3.2 The applicant was earning Rs. 392 per day and her livelihood as
well as her two minor daughters' education depended entirely on this
employment.

3.3 The respondent No. 5 acted with personal prejudice against the
applicant and upon facing resistance, orchestrated the applicant
removal from service without following due process. The applicant has
made complaints in this regard to the respondents' authorities but no
remedial action has been taken as yet.

4. The Counter Affidavit has been filed on behalf of the
Respondents on 23.02.2024 stated as under:

4.1 The applicant, Shivani Verma, was never engaged or recruited in
any official capacity in the Jhansi Division. She was merely called for
work on a daily wage basis for specific tasks like cleaning (Safai) and
SUSHIL maintenance (Farrash) as per the department's requirement and she
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
was duly paid for the work performed. However, she was never formally
appointed to any post within the department nor did she hold any
regular or contractual employment status.
4.2 Despite this, the applicant has filed multiple complaints against
the Senior Superintendent of Post Offices, Jhansi Division and other
officials including allegations against Sri Devendra Singh, the then
Assistant Superintendent of Post Offices (HQ), Jhansi. She submitted
complaints to various authorities including the District Magistrate, the
Chief Postmaster General and the Assistant Labour Commissioner
seeking her engagement in the department. The allegations were duly
inquired into by the department through Assistant Superintendent of
Post Offices (North), Jhansi, who conducted a fact-finding inquiry. The
inquiry report dated 17.05.2023 along with the statement of the officer
concerned concluded that the allegations were entirely baseless and
without merit. Additionally, the applicant was contacted for her
statement during the inquiry but she refused to provide any response.

4.3 Furthermore, another complaint concerning the applicant was
received on the DOPG Portal on 19.07.2023 forwarded by one Vinod
Kumar Singh. A suitable reply was given to the complainant clarifying
that the applicant was never engaged in the department.

5. Notice was issued to Respondent-5 by this Tribunal on
10.07.2023; however, despite sufficient time and opportunity, no
counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of Respondent-5. In the
absence of any rebuttal from the said respondent, the matter is being
considered based on the pleadings and submissions available on record.

6. In the Rejoinder Affidavit, the applicant submits that she was
unfairly removed from her job and her complaints were dismissed due
SUSHIL
KUMAR
to the influence of Shri Devendra Singh, Assistant Superintendent
SRIVASTAVA
(Headquarters), Jhansi. She submitted complaints to various authorities
including the District Magistrate, Police, Labor Commission and
Government officials but at every stage, investigations were
manipulated in favor of Shri Devendra Singh. The applicant further
submits that she was continuously employed since 31.05.2017 and was
wrongly dismissed without due process. It is also submitted that
departmental investigations lacked female members and pressure was
exerted on her to withdraw her complaint.

7. The learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant
was engaged as a casual laborer under the respondents since
31.05.2017 and continuously discharged her duties until her abrupt
removal on 17.04.2023. The applicant was earning Rs. 392 per day and
was assigned regular clerical tasks.

7.1 The counsel submits that her removal was arbitrary, without any
notice or due process and was carried out with mala fide intent by
respondent-5, against whom the applicant had raised objections.

7.2 The applicant has made multiple representations to higher
authorities, including the District Magistrate and the Chief Postmaster
General but no relief has been granted.

7.3 It is further submitted that the inquiry report relied upon by the
respondents is biased lacks independent scrutiny and was influenced
by officials against whom the applicant had made allegations.
Additionally, the absence of female members in the inquiry committee
and the pressure exerted on the applicant to withdraw her complaints
further highlight the unfair treatment meted out to her.

8. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submits that the
applicant, Shivani Verma, was never formally engaged or appointed in
SUSHIL any official capacity within the Jhansi Division but was merely called
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
for work on a daily wage basis as per departmental requirements for
tasks such as cleaning (Safai) and maintenance (Farrash) for which she
was duly paid.

8.1 It is further contended that the applicant does not hold any
regular or contractual employment status and has no legal right to seek
continued engagement or salary payments.

8.2 The respondents further contend that the applicant has filed
multiple complaints against departmental officials including the
Senior Superintendent of Post Offices and the then Assistant
Superintendent of Post Offices (HQ), Jhansi making baseless
allegations without any substantiating evidence. A fact-finding
inquiry was conducted by the Assistant Superintendent of Post Offices
(North), Jhansi, and the inquiry report dated 17.05.2023, along with
statements of concerned officers, concluded that the applicant's claims
were without merit. Additionally, the applicant was given an
opportunity to present her case during the inquiry but refused to
provide a statement. The respondents also highlight that a complaint
forwarded through the DOPG Portal on 19.07.2023 was duly
addressed, clarifying that the applicant was never engaged in the
department. Therefore, the claim for reinstatement and salary is
untenable and the Original Application deserves to be dismissed.

9. Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel for
both parties and upon perusal of the records, it is evident that the
applicant was engaged on a casual basis without any formal
appointment or contractual employment. The respondents have
categorically stated that the applicant was engaged for specific tasks
as per departmental requirements and was paid accordingly. There is
no documentary evidence on record to establish that the applicant was
SUSHIL
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
ever appointed in an official capacity or had any legal right to claim
continuity of service.

10. At the same time, the applicant has raised grievances regarding
alleged arbitrary removal and personal bias of respondent No. 5. While
the inquiry report dated 17.05.2023 does not support the applicant's
claims, it is also noted that the applicant has not been given a fresh
opportunity to present her case comprehensively before the competent
authority.

11. At this stage, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that
the applicant may be granted liberty to file a fresh representation
before the competent authority among the respondents raising all her
grievances. It was further requested that a direction may be issued to
the respondents to consider and decide the said representation within
a stipulated time frame by passing a reasoned and speaking order.

12. Learned counsel for the respondents has no objection to the
aforesaid request.

13. In view of the above and with the consent of both parties, the
present Original Application is disposed of with the direction to the
applicant to submit a fresh representation detailing all her grievances
before the competent authority among the respondents within a period
of two weeks from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.
Upon submission of such representation, the competent authority shall
duly consider the same and dispose of it by passing a reasoned and
speaking order within a period of three months from the date of receipt
of such representation in accordance with the applicable rules and
legal provisions.

14. No order as to costs.

SUSHIL All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of. The
KUMAR

M.As.

OR D E R

Delivered by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Joshi, Member (Judicial)

Heard Shri S.M.A. Naqvi, learned counsel for the applicant and
Shri Ajay Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for the respondents.

SUSHIL 2. Instant Original Application has been filed by the applicant for
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA
challenging the impugned orders dated 10.05.2016 passed by
Respondents by which the services of the applicant under Rule 8(2) of
GDS (Conduct & Engagement) Rules 2011 is terminated with
immediate effect.

3. The facts in brief are the applicant, in response to a notification
issued by Respondent No.3, The Superintendent of Post Offices, Kanpur
(M) Division, Kanpur, applied on 06.11.2012 for the post of Gramin Dak
Sevak Branch Post Master (GDS BPM) in the Kanpur (M) Postal
Division under the Kanpur Postal Region in the year 2012.

3.1. After undergoing the required selection process and completing
all formalities, the applicant was found successful and was
engaged/appointed to the post by Respondent No.3. The applicant
formally assumed charge of the position as GDS BPM at Mazara
Piperkhera, Account Office - Ganga Ghat, District Unnao, under the
Kanpur (M) Postal Division on 06.01.2014. However, on 10.05.2016,
Respondent No.2 issued a directive to Respondent No.3, instructing the
immediate cancellation of the applicant's appointment under Rule 8(2)
of Gramin Dak Sewak (Conduct & Engagement) Rules, 2011.

3.2 Being aggrieved, the applicant has filed the instating Original
Application by challenging the aforesaid dismissal order.

4. On notice, the respondents have filed counter reply on
19.02.2020 by which they have denied the claim of the applicant and
submitted that the respondents submitted a notification for the
appointment to the vacant post of GDS (BPM) Majhara Piperkhera
(Gangaghat), Unnao was issued on 08.10.2012, with the last date for
receiving applications being 07.11.2012. The post was earmarked for the
Unreserved (U.R.) category. The applicant, Shri Saurabh Katariya,
SUSHIL
KUMAR applied for the position as a general candidate on 02.11.2012 and was
SRIVASTAVA
shown in the 5th position in the merit list. Despite this, the then
appointing authority, Shri G.P. Bajpai, appointed the applicant
bypassing four higher-merit candidates.
4.1 Following complaints regarding irregularities in the
engagement process, a review was conducted at the R.O. level
revealing serious procedural lapses. As a result, the competent
authority ordered the cancellation of the applicant's engagement
referencing Rule 8 of the GDS (Conduct and Engagement) Rules, 2011.
The applicant's engagement was terminated on 10.05.2016 as he had
served less than three years in the post.

4.2 The respondents emphasized that the selection criteria for GDS
posts is merit-based, primarily determined by the marks obtained in
the High School examination. This criterion is in line with the GDS
(Conduct and Engagement) Rules, 2011.

4.3 The respondents further pointed out that the actions of Shri G.P.
Bajpai, the then SPO Kanpur (M) Division were found to be irregular
and illegal resulting in a CBI FIR and disciplinary proceedings against
him. These actions were deemed to be in violation of departmental rules
and merit-based selection.

4.4 In response to the termination of engagement, the applicant filed
present Original Application before this Tribunal. However, the
respondents contended that the OA was filed approximately three
years after the termination order dated 10.05.2016, which is considered
time-barred. Therefore, the respondents argued that the OA should be
dismissed on the grounds of delay.

5 Learned counsel for the applicant has also filed a rejoinder
SUSHIL
KUMAR affidavit denying the contentions of the respondents' counsel and
SRIVASTAVA
reiterated the facts mentioned in the Original Application.

6. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the
termination of the applicant's services by the respondents was unjust
and illegal. The applicant was duly selected and appointed to the post
of GDS BPM following a proper notification and selection process. The
applicant fulfilled all formalities and assumed charge of the post in
January 2014. The termination order issued in May 2016 was arbitrary
and violated the principles of natural justice. The delay in filing the OA
has already been condoned by this Tribunal vide order dated
06.07.2022.

6.1 Learned counsel for the applicant further stated that this
Tribunal had decided a bunch of matters on the identical issue,
including the leading OA No.742 of 2016 (
Birbal vs. Union of India &
Ors.
) and allowed the OA with certain directions.

The Union of India
filed Writ Petition No.5198 of 2018 (
Union of India and 2 others vs.
Birbal and another
) against the Tribunal's order, but the Allahabad
High Court dismissed the writ petition along with all connected
matters on 30.04.2018. Therefore, the applicant seeks the quashing of
the termination order and reinstatement to the position.

7. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that
the applicant's engagement was terminated lawfully under Rule 8(2)
of the GDS (Conduct & Engagement) Rules, 2011 due to serious
irregularities in the selection process conducted by the then appointing
authority, Shri G.P. Bajpai. The respondents contended that the
applicant was appointed despite being in the 5th position in the merit
list bypassing four higher-merit candidates, which was a violation of
the merit-based selection process. Following complaints regarding the
SUSHIL irregularities, a review was conducted and it was found that the
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA appointment was made in an unlawful manner. The competent
authority, therefore, ordered the cancellation of the engagement. The
respondents also highlighted that the selection criteria for GDS posts
are strictly merit-based, determined by the marks obtained in the High
School examination, and the actions of Shri G.P. Bajpai were found to
be illegal resulting in an FIR and disciplinary proceedings. However,
learned counsel for the respondents also confirmed that the identical
issue has already been decided by this Tribunal, against which the Writ
Petition filed by Union of India before the Allahabad High Court was
also dismissed.

8. We have considered the rival submissions advanced by learned
counsel for both parties and perused the pleadings available on record.

8.1 It is evident from the record that the termination of the
applicant's services under Rule 8(2) of the GDS (Conduct &
Engagement) Rules, 2011 is rooted in the allegation of procedural
irregularities in the selection process conducted by the then appointing
authority, Shri G.P. Bajpai. The applicant was appointed despite being
placed 5th in the merit list bypassing four higher-merit candidates, a
clear violation of the merit-based selection process mandated under
the GDS (Conduct & Engagement) Rules, 2011. The respondent's
actions in terminating the applicant's engagement were taken after a
review at the Regional Office level, which found serious lapses in the
selection procedure. Additionally, the actions of Shri G.P. Bajpai, the
then appointing authority, were found to be illegal, resulting in a CBI
FIR and disciplinary proceedings.

8.2 While the respondents have raised the issue of delay in filing the
Original Application, the same was addressed and condoned by this

SUSHIL
Tribunal in its order dated 06.07.2022. Furthermore, the applicant has
KUMAR
SRIVASTAVA cited the decision of this Tribunal in OA No.742 of 2016 (
Birbal vs.
Union of India & Ors.
), which was upheld by the Allahabad High
Court in Writ Petition No. 5198 of 2018 and the respondents have not
shown any substantial ground to distinguish the present case from the
aforementioned decisions.

8.3 In light of the fact that the applicant was duly appointed
following the prescribed selection process and considering the
dismissal of the Writ Petition by the Allahabad High Court in identical
cases, the termination order dated 10.05.2016 passed by the
respondents appears to be arbitrary and unjust.

8.4 For ready reference, the operative part of the order dated
14.07.2017 passed by this Tribunal in OA No.742/2016 is reproduced
as under:-

"29. Thus, all the cases in hand could be trifurcated as -

(1) Cases where the termination is on the ground of certain
irregularities in the very selection thereby attracting
Rule 4(3) of the Rules which warrant issue of show
cause notice, which admittedly has not been issued to
the applicants, consequent to which the impugned
orders are to be treated as legally unsustainable.

(2) Cases where on account of misconduct, termination has
taken places which, in fact, are to be proceeded under
Rule 9 and 10 and, consequently, the order of
termination under 8(2) becomes illegal and legally
unsustainable.

(3) Cases which do not fall under the two categories and
fall under Rule 8(2) of the Rules, but the ingredients
thereof, i.e. unsatisfactory service or administrative
ground do not exist, consequent to which the impugned
order of termination becomes legally unsustainable.

30. Cases filling in each category could be easily made out
from the counter filed by the respondents.

31. In view of the above, except the following O.As, in
SUSHIL
KUMAR
which pleadings are not complete, as held in para 16 above, all
SRIVASTAVA other O.As are allowed and orders impugned therein are
hereby quashed and set aside:-

(a) OAs 886/2016; (b) 32/2017, (c) 33/2017; (d)
564/2017; (e) 565/2017; (f) 602/2017; (g) 685/2017
and (h) 690/2017.

It is declared that the applicants are entitled to
reinstatement and further, they are entitled to the
consequential benefits, i.e. for full TRCA for the period they
have been kept out of service. If any of their places has been
filled up by someone, the applicants shall be accommodated
in any other vacant post and at the earliest opportunity they
shall be brought back to their original post. This order shall be
complied with within a period of six weeks from today.
Necessary orders for reinstatement be issued accordingly.
Arrears of TRCA be disbursed within two months from the
date of reinstatement.

Liberty is given to the respondents to proceed against
the applicants falling under category (1) and (2) above.

32. No orders as to costs."

8.5 It is also necessary to reproduce the relevant part of the order
dated 30.04.2018 passed by the Allahabad High Court in Writ
Petition No.49864/2017, along with other connected matters, by
which the order passed by this Tribunal was upheld by the Allahabad
High Court:-

"...........

34. The proposition advanced above cannot be disputed and we
find no reason to take a different view in the matter. However, here
the fact situation is different. Applicant-respondents have been
terminated with reference to Rule 8 of Rules 2011 by Appointing
Authority but admittedly, said orders have been passed in
furtherance of orders/directions given by Superior Authority,
noticing some irregularities in appointment of Gramin Dak Sevaks,
by exercising power under Rule 4(3). The mere fact that in
termination orders, except a few one, reference of orders of Superior
Authorities is not there but this is an admitted fact by petitioner that
appointments were reviewed by Superior Authorities and finding
irregularities, directions were issued and thereafter Appointing
Authority issued orders of termination simplicitor, therefore, the
manner in which orders of termination simplicitor have been passed
is nothing but a camouflage so as to avoid specific requirement of
SUSHIL
KUMAR compliance of principles of natural justice, enshrined under Rule 4(3)
SRIVASTAVA of Rules 2011. Hence, the aforesaid exposition of law
laid down in

Paras Nath Pandey Vs. Director, North Central Zone, Cultural
Centre (supra) has no application to the facts of present writ petitions.

35. We find that termination orders passed by Appointing
Authority are in the backdrop of directions/orders of Superior
Authority, noticing some irregularities etc. in appointments of
Gramin Dak Sevaks and in view of noncompliance of Rule 4(3) i.e.
opportunity of hearing to concern Gramin Dak Sevaks, the same are
vitiated in law.

36. In view of above discussion, we do not find any manifest error
in judgments of Tribunal warranting interference. It is always open to
petitioners to pass fresh orders after complying with the requirement
of Rules. Hence, we find no valid reason to interfere with judgments of
Tribunal, impugned in all these writ petitions.

37. Writ petitions, for the reasons discussed above, lack merit and
are dismissed, accordingly. No costs"

8.6 Following the decision cited above, we find no reason to adopt a
different view in the matter. Accordingly, the Original Application is
allowed. The impugned termination order dated 10.05.2016 is hereby
quashed. The respondents are directed to reinstate the applicant to the
post of GDS BPM at Mazara Piperkhera, Account Office - Ganga Ghat,
District Unnao with all consequential benefits within two months from
the date of this order.

9. No order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of. The
registry will take appropriate action in this regard for removing the
M.As.

Heard Shri Surya Bhan Singh, learned counsel for the applicant and
Shri Chakrapani Vatsyayan, learned counsel for the respondents.

SUSHIL
KUMAR 2. The mater is listed under the heading of Admission. With the
SRIVASTAVA
consent of learned counsel for both the parties, the same is disposed of
at the admission stage itself.

3. The applicant has filed the instant Original Application
under
Section 19
of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985,
seeking a direction to the respondents to conduct the document
verification and medical examination of the applicant by fixing a
date for the same in respect of the selection process conducted
pursuant to the Centralized Employment Notice (CEN) No. RRC-
01/2019 (Level-1). The applicant further prays for a direction to
respondent No. 3 to consider and decide the applicant's
representations dated 02.12.2024 and 09.12.2024 within a
specified period.

4. The case of the applicant is that he had applied for the
Group-D posts advertised by Northern Central Railway (NCR)
through the Centralised Employment Notice (CEN) No. 01/2019.
He appeared and passed the written test on 26.08.2022 and the
Physical Efficiency Test (PET) on 16.01.2023. However, despite
securing 67.28 marks, which were above the cut-off for the
unreserved category (66.50 marks), the applicant was not called
for the document verification (DV) process, which took place from
13.02.2023 to 23.03.2023. The applicant later found out through
social media on 24.11.2024 that a reduced cut-off of 66.50 marks
had been declared and that document verification was ongoing.

5. Upon learning this, the applicant immediately contacted
SUSHIL
KUMAR
the respondent and requested an opportunity to participate in the
SRIVASTAVA
next round of document verification. Despite submitting multiple
representations, including on 02.12.2024 and 09.12.2024, the
respondents failed to address his requests. As a result, the applicant
was unable to participate in the scheduled document verification
process.

6. The applicant has stated that his absence from the document
verification process on 01.12.2023 was due to not receiving any
communication and not due to any intentional negligence. He has
requested the Tribunal that a direction may be issued to the
respondents authorities to decide his pending representation
dated 02.12.2024 followed by reminder dated 09.12.2024
regarding his document verification.

7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents
stated that he has no objection to the applicant's request for
deciding his pending representation in a timely manner and in
accordance with the rules.

8. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and
considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the
opinion that the applicant's grievance may be addressed by
directing the respondents to consider and decide his pending
representations.

9. Accordingly, the Original Application is disposed of with a
direction to Competent Authority among the respondents to
SUSHIL
KUMAR
consider and decide the applicant's representations dated
SRIVASTAVA
02.12.2024 and 09.12.2024, in accordance with the rules within
one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order
and decision thereof be communicated to the applicant forthwith.

10. It is clarified that this Tribunal has not expressed any opinion
on the merits of the case, and the decision on the applicant's
representations shall be taken independently in accordance with
the applicable rules and regulations.

11. There shall be no order as to costs.

All pending M.As, if any, shall be treated as disposed of. The
registry will take appropriate action in this regard for removing the
