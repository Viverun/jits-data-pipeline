JUDGMENT

This is a Petition filed by the Petitioner under
Section 34
of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 for setting aside the
Arbitral Award dated 01.06.2017 passed by the learned Sole
Arbitrator.

2. The Respondent No. 1 "M/s United Foundation Private
Limited" had invoked the Arbitration Agreement and preferred
certain Claims against "K.M.B. Estates LLP" the Petitioner.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

3. The Brief facts leading to the case are as follows:-

The Petitioner is the developer of the property who
undertook to construct both residential and commercial
buildings at the project site, which belongs to Krishna E
Campus, that the Respondent No. 1 approached to undertake
the work and issued a quotation as per Ex.R.26, that
subsequently after deliberations the Respondent No. 1 issued
Ex.R.1/ letter and re-considered the dewatering system with
deep well method, that the Petitioner had handed over Ex.R.2/
Soil Test Reports to the Respondent No. 1, that the Respondent
No. 1 submitted revised quotation in the meeting held as per
Ex.R.27, that the Respondent No. 1 also issued Ex.R.28/ Letter
stating that the program for strutting and demolishing of soil
nails and subsequent earth work has to be worked out with the
main contractor, thereafter Ex.C.1/ Letter of Intent was issued,
that the Respondent No. 1 failed to keep up with time schedule
and failed to provide proper works in terms of schedule, that the
Respondent No. 1 was required to start earth work excavation
works on 02.04.2013, but the work have never started on time,
that the Respondent No. 1 claimed payments as per Ex.R.19,
that the PMC has issued Ex.R.29/ email to the Respondent No. 1
to put up safety boards and safety manuals, that the
Respondent No. 1 sent Ex.R.31/ email seeking payments, that
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

the PMC issued Ex.R.32/ email seeking reasons for not
deploying proper machinery and man power, that the PMC
granted permission to the Respondent No. 1 to engage the
services of BBF Group as per Ex.P.75/ email, that RA Bill No.1
was forwarded to the PMC as per Ex.R.35, that the PMC as per
Ex.R.36/ email elaborating the necessary documents and the

claims, the Petitioner made payments of Rs. 31,22,718/- to the
Respondent No. 1 as per Ex.R.41, that the PMC as per Ex.R.42,
mentioned the actual date of completion of work, that according
to the Respondent No. 1, he has carried out works in terms of
conditions and submitted RA Bills to the Petitioner, that however
they have not paid entire amount and hence he has filed the
Claim Petition before the learned Arbitrator and after enquiry,
the learned Arbitrator has passed the Impugned Award and
allowed the Claim Petition in part and rejected the counter claim
of the Petitioner.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

4. Being aggrieved by the said Arbitral Award, the Petitioner
has challenged the same on several grounds, which will be
discussed later in the body of the Judgment.

5. The Respondent No. 1 has submitted on 13.06.2019 that
no written statement to be filed in this case since everything
was placed before the Arbitral Tribunal.

6. The records of the Arbitral Tribunal are secured. I have
heard the arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner and the
arguments of the Advocate for the Respondent No. 1. The
Advocate for the Petitioner has filed Written Arguments on
18.03.2021. The Advocate for the Respondent has filed his
written arguments on 08.04.2021.

7. Based on the above contentions of both parties, following
Points arise for my consideration:-

1. Whether there are grounds to set aside the
Impugned Award under
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act?

2. What Order?
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

8. My findings on the above points are as follows:-

Point No.1:- In the Negative.

Point No.2:- As per the final Order for
the following reasons.

REASONS

9. Point No.1: - The Respondent No.1 has preferred a
Claim Petition before the Learned Arbitrator for Rs.
3,31,03,442/- under 13 heads. The Petitioner has raised a
counter-claim of Rs. 3,63,01,025/- with interest at 18% per
annum from the date of Letter of Intent till the commencement
of Arbitration and from that date till the amounts are paid.

10. The Learned Arbitrator has partly allowed the claims of
the Respondent No.1 and dismissed the Counter Claim of the
Petitioner in the Impugned Award. It is to be noted that the
Respondent No. 1 has not challenged the rejection of the
portion of his Claims.

11. The Petitioner has challenged the said Impugned Award
in this proceeding. The Hon'ble High Court in the Judgment
dated 17.04.2021 in Com.A.P.No.25/2021 (Union of India
vs. M/s Warsaw Engineers), has laid down certain
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

guidelines/principles about the writing of Judgments in a
Petition filed under
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act. Keeping in my mind the said guidelines, I now propose to
examine each and every ground urged by the Petitioner
specifically with reference to the submissions made by both
Advocates.

12. By considering the facts of the case and the arguments of
both Advocates, I now propose to answer the grounds urged by
the Petitioner.

13. The First ground is that the Impugned Award is totally
perverse, contrary to laws, public policy of India, is completely
unconscionable, shocks the conscience and causes considerable
and tremendous prejudice to the rights of the Petitioner.

13.a. This is a general ground and the same will be discussed
along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.

14. The Second ground is that the learned Arbitrator has
ignored all material facts and has embarked on enquiry which is
alien to the matter, that he has come to several unsupported
inferences and the award is full of such inferences and
conjectures which are not sustainable either in law or on facts.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

14.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be
discussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.

15. The Third ground is that the learned Arbitrator has not
considered applicable laws, the provisions cited and such non-
consideration would render the award contrary to the public
policy.

15.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be
discussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.

16. The Fourth ground is that the Principle of natural
justice is not followed, that contentions and documents
produced by the Petitioner have been ignored and blindly
accepted the contentions and documents of the Respondent
No.1 and thereby the reasoning based on misinterpretation of
facts and evidence.

16.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Impugned Award is contrary to
Section 34
of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act since most of the contentions
put forth by the Petitioner which have been rejected without
any reasoning or basis, that the principles of natural justice
being required to be followed by the Tribunal, that the same
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

have not been followed, on one hand the contentions and
documents produced by the Petitioner have been ignored and
on the other hand, the contentions urged by the Respondent
No.1, though false, baseless, untenable, contrary to record,
contrary to evidence on record, have been plainly accepted
without reasoning based on the misinterpretation,
misrepresentation of facts, evidence and applicable law, that
the Rules of the proceedings have been laid down prior to the
commencement of trial, that the Tribunal has unilaterally
changed the Rules at the time of the Award by holding that the
burden of proof pales into insignificance at Para 27 of the
Award, that there is no such concept in law, that the Rules and
procedure as agreed between the parties cannot be changed
post the Arbitration, that such a change if at all was sought to
be made ought to have been informed to the Petitioner which
has not been done, that therefore, the vested right in the
Petitioner has been taken away by the Tribunal thereby violating
the principles of natural justice which are inherent in an
Arbitration proceedings, that in terms of Rule 18 of the
Arbitration Centre, Karnataka (Domestic and International)
Rules 2012 it is required for the Tribunal to secure agreement of
parties to dispense with formal proof of documents except in
case of questioned documents, that there being no such
agreement, the said Rule had to be followed since the same
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

was not followed the Award liable to be quashed, that the
Tribunal ought to have applied the principles of burden of proof
and onus of proof form a substantial portion of Arbitration
proceedings and the Tribunal ought to have acted in accordance
with the issue as framed and not travel beyond it or dilute the
issues in the matter as done, that this is violative of public
policy, unknown to judicial procedure and amounts to Judicial
malafide on part of the Arbitrator, on this ground alone the
award is liable to be set aside.

16.b. In this aspect, it is to be noted that in the decision
reported in A.I.R. - 1988 - S.C. - 1340 (
Indian Oil
Corporation vs. Indian Carbon Ltd
), it is held as follows:-

"It is one thing to say that reasons should be stated
and another thing to state that a detailed judgment is to
be given in support of an award. Even if it be held it is
obligatory to state the reason, it is not obligatory to
give a detailed judgment".

16.c. A similar view was also taken by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1989 - S.C.

- 973 (
Gujarat Water Supply vs. Unique Erectors
).

16.d. Similar views were expressed by Full Bench (5 Hon'ble
Judges Bench) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision
reported in A.I.R. - 1991 - S.C. - 2089 (
Goa, Daman & Diu
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Housing Board vs. Ramakant V.P. Darvotkar
), wherein the
Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-

" There is however nothing to show that the awards
have been improperly procured. There is no allegation,
far less, any finding, that the Arbitrator was biased or
unfair or he has not heard both the parties or he has not
fairly considered the submission of the parties in
making the award in question. In our opinion, it is
evident from the four awards made by the Arbitrator,
that the Arbitrator has considered the submission of the
parties in making the award in question. In our opinion,
it is evident from the four awards made by the
Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator has considered all the
relevant issues raised by the parties in the Arbitrator
proceedings and came to his finding after giving cogent
reasons. The above award cannot under any
circumstances be considered to be made by the
Arbitrator without recording any reasons for the same.
Therefore, in such circumstances, it is not proper to hold
that the Arbitrator has misconducted himself or the
proceedings in the matter of giving the awards".

16.e. In another decision reported in 2014 (9) - S.C.C. -
212 (
Anand Brothers Private Limited vs. Union of India
and Others
), at Para No. 12 has considered and decided the
phrase 'finding' and in Para No. 13 defined the phrase
"conclusion" and further regarding the finding and speaking
order the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para No. 14 has held as under:-
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

"It is trite that a finding can be both; a finding of
fact or a finding of law........This is the rule also in the
case of finding of fact where too the process of
reasoning must be disclosed in order that it is accepted
as a finding in the sense the expression is used in
Clause 70".

16.f. In the present case also though there is a contention
of the Petitioner that the Tribunal has changed the Rules of
proceedings at the time of passing the award, there is no
allegation about any other aspects. The Arbitrator has given
cogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the Impugned
Award. Therefore, in view of the ratio of aforesaid decisions, it
has to be examined by perusing of the Impugned Award
wherein the learned Arbitrator dealt with each and every claim
separately and recorded the reasoning for allowing or
disallowing the claim. Hence, as per the ratio of the above
decisions, the said contentions of the Petitioner cannot be
accepted. The award cannot be set aside on the said ground.

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

17. The Fifth ground is that the Impugned Award has been
passed in contravention of terms of the agreement and on a
fundamental misconception of evidence and ignoring the
material evidence.

17.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Impugned Award is in contravention to the Letter of
Intent entered into between the parties, that the Award being
contrary to terms of the contract the same is to be interfered
with the ground that it is patently illegal and is opposed to
Public Policy of India, that the Tribunal being a creature of the
contract, ought to act only in terms of the contract and could
not travel beyond it, that the Tribunal ought to strictly apply the
terms of the contract in arriving at a decision in regard to the
matter in dispute, that the Tribunal could not have traveled
beyond the terms of the contract.

17.b. On perusal of the Impugned Award with the terms of
the contract between the parties, it cannot be held that the
learned Arbitrator has completely ignored the terms of the
contract and traveled beyond all the terms of the contract while
interpreting the same.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

17.c.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The findings of fact by the Arbitral Tribunal, if based on
evidence, even where a different opinion can be held on the
basis of that evidence, the findings given by the Arbitrator has
to be accepted and the Courts cannot substitute its opinion. The
power to interpret the contract also lies with the Arbitrator. If
the Arbitrator interpreted the terms of contract in a particular
way based on the material before him and the evidence
adduced before him, even if another view is possible to be
taken on the same materials and evidence, the Court cannot
interfere the said findings of the learned Arbitrator, as held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in 2009(6)

- S.C.C. - 414 (
G.Ramachandra Reddy & Company vs.
Union of India & another
), wherein it is held that the
interpretation of a contract will fall within the realm of
arbitrator, that the Court while dealing with an award would not
re-appreciate the evidence, that an award containing reasons
may not be interfered unless they are found to be perverse or
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

based on a wrong proposition of law.

In another decision
reported in 2009 (10) - S.C.C. - 63 (
Steel Authority of
India Limited vs. Gupta Brothers Steel Tubes Limited
), it
is held that once the arbitrator has constructed Clause 7.2 of
the contract of the said case, in a particular manner and such
construction is not absurd and appears to be plausible, it is not
open to the Court to interfere with the award of the arbitrator.

17.d. For the same principle, I wish to refer another
decision reported in 2019 (7) - S.C.C. - 236 (
Parsa Kenta
Collieries Limited vs. Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan
Nigam Limited
). Once the courts reach to the conclusion that
the Arbitrator has acted within its jurisdiction, even if the courts
are of the view that the opinion of the arbitrator is wrong the
same cannot be disturbed unless it is against the public policy.

17.e. Therefore, an award warrants interference by the
Court under
Section 34
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act
only when it contravenes a substantive provision of law or is
patently illegal or shocks the conscious of the Court and that a
plausible/reasonable view taken by an Arbitrator, even if the
same is based on insufficient evidence, is not to be substituted
by the Court. Hence, this ground is not available for the
Petitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.

18. The Sixth ground is that the learned Arbitrator ignored
the arguments and has gone beyond the pleadings and
evidence.

18.a. This is also a general ground and the same will be
discussed along with other grounds urged by the Petitioner.

19. The Seventh ground is that the claim of the 1 st
Respondent about the alleged dues until RA Bill 4 allegedly
certified has no support of any evidence and the same was
awarded which is contrary to the evidence and pleadings.

19.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that though the 1st Respondent has prayed for Rs.91,83,693/-
towards the alleged dues until RA Bill No.4 allegedly certified,
without any evidence about the certification, the Tribunal has
awarded Rs. 1,30,62,323/-, towards Bill No. 1 to 4. It is to be
noted that as already discussed by me, the learned Arbitrator
has discussed the contentions and evidence of both parties in
the Impugned Award. If any, calculation mistakes crept in the
award, this court cannot interfere about the same in this
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

proceedings. Therefore, there are no grounds to accept the said
contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this ground is not available
for the Petitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and rejected.

20. The Eighth ground is that the learned Arbitrator could
not have considered the so called RA Bill 1 to 4 in the absence
of satisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36.

20.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that RA Bills 1 to 4 to be running bills in the absence of them
satisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1, LOI, Ex.P.2 and Ex.R.36,
that there is absolutely no finding by the Tribunal that the
above conditions precedent have been satisfied, that such
being the case the so called RA Bill 1 to 4 could have not even
been considered by the Tribunal.

20.b. This ground is more or less similar to that of seventh
ground. Hence, for the same reasons, the contentions of the
Petitioner cannot be accepted. Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-Section (2) and Sub-
Section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is thwarted and
rejected.

21. The Ninth ground is that the learned Arbitrator could
not have considered the so called RA Bill No.5 in the absence of
satisfying the requirements of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36, and by
relying on Ex.P.76 only.

21.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that as regards prayer at Sl. No.3 Page 18 of the Award towards
the alleged 5th RA Bill, the claim made by the 1 st Respondent
was for a sum of Rs. 32,34,127/- which has been awarded by
the Tribunal, that while doing so, the Tribunal has considered
Ex.P.76 being the e-mail of an Excel Sheet as a RA Bill and not
considered the requirements under Ex.P.1, LOI, Ex.P.2, BOQ and
Ex.R.36, that without first satisfying the requirements of a RA
Bill, Ex.P.76 could not be considered to be a RA Bill, that apart
there is no certification of Ex.P.76 by the PMC nor as the 1 st
Respondent claimed for such certification, that Ex.P.76 adds
back all the deductions made by PMC, that the award directing
the payment towards the alleged RA Bill No.5 in the form of
Excel Sheet is liable to be set aside.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

21.b. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has
argued that the Petitioner denied the submission of RA Bill No.5
by the 1st Respondent to PMC, that the RA Bill No.5 was sent by
the 1st Respondent to PMC on 04.12.2013, that since there was
no communication from the PMC, the 1 st Respondent sent one
more copy of RA Bill No.5 on 06.12.2013 to PMC through e-mail
as per Ex.P.76, that PMC has not certified the payment claimed
by the 1st Respondent in RA Bill No.5.

21.c. The same aspect is once again agitated at twelfth
ground. About the factual aspect, I shall discuss about the same
while answering the twelfth ground. However, the aspect about
sending the RA Bill through e-mail as per Ex.P.76 is concerned,
though the same is not in terms of the contract between the
parties, the same is to be considered in the light of provisions of

Information Technology Act
. With regard to the said aspect, I
now discuss about the same.

21.d.
Sections 4
and
of the Information Technology Act,
2000 provide for legal recognition of electronic records and
their use in Government and its agencies. Section10-A of the
said Act specifically provides for validity of contract through
electronic means and accordingly provides that such contract
shall not be deemed to be unenforceable solely on the ground
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

that such electronic form or means was used for that purpose.

Section 12
of the said Act provides for acknowledgment of
receipt including in an automated manner.
Section 13
of the
said Act provides for time and place of dispatch and receipt of
electronic records. Upon careful consideration of all these
provisions, it is seen that electronic records have been provided
with full legal recognition.

21.e. Under the provisions of the
Information Technology Act,
particularly Section 10-A, an electronic contract is valid and
enforceable, which states as follows:-

"Section 10-A: Validity of contracts formed through
electronic means:- Where in a contract formation, the
communication of proposals, the acceptance of
proposals, the revocation of proposals and acceptances,
as the case may be, are expressed in electronic form or
by means of an electronic record, such contract shall not
be deemed to be unenforceable solely on the ground
that such electronic form or means was used for that
purpose."

21.f. E-Contracts can be entered into through modes of
communication such as e-mail, internet and fax. The only
essential requirement to validate an E-Contract is compliance with
the necessary pre-requisites provided under the
Indian Contract
Act, 1872
.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

21.g. The evidentiary value of e-contracts can be well
understood in the light of the Sections 85A, 85B, 88A, 90A and
85C deals with the presumptions as to electronic records whereas
Section 65B relates to the admissibility of electronic record. In the
present case, there is no dispute about the admissibility of various
e-mails exchanged between the parties.

21.h. Formation of contracts online via emails has been
recognized and given validity to by the Indian courts time and
again. In the decision reported in 2010(1) - SCALE - 57 (Trimex
International FZE Limited, Dubai vs. Vendata Aluminium
Ltd.), the parties thoroughly agreed to the terms of the contract
via emails. The Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the validity of this
contract and further held as follows:-

"Once the contract is concluded orally or in writing,
the mere fact that a formal contract has to be prepared
and initiated by the parties would not affect either the
acceptance of the contract so entered into or
implementation thereof, even if the formal contract has
never been initiated."

21.i. In the said case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court after going
through the various E-mails exchanged between the parties
including an E-mail attaching the draft contract, which remained
unsigned, opined as follows:-
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

"44. From the materials placed, it has to be
ascertained whether there exists a valid contract with
the arbitration clause. It is relevant to note that on 15-

10-2007 at 4.26 p.m. the petitioner submitted a
commercial offer wherein Clause 6 contains the
arbitration clause i.e. "this contract is governed by
Indian law and arbitration in Mumbai courts". At 5.34
p.m. though the respondents offered their comments, as
rightly pointed out by Mr. K.K. Venugopal, no comments
were made in respect of the "arbitration clause". It is
further seen that at 6.04 p.m., the petitioner sent a
reply to the comments made by the respondent. Again,
on 16-10-2007 at 11.28 a.m., though the respondents
suggested certain additional information on the offer
note, here again no suggestion was made with regard to
the arbitration clause...........".

21.j. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in
(2001) 7 - S.C.C. - 328 (
Smita Conductors Limited vs. Euro
Alloys Limited
), has commented about two contracts and held
that one of the party had in his mind those contracts while
opening the letters of credit and while addressing the letters to the
bank in that regard and had also invoked force majuere clause in
those contracts which would obviously mean that the parties had
in their mind those two contracts which stood formed by those
letters of credit. It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that if two
contracts stood affirmed by reason of conduct of the parties as
indicated in the letters exchanged, it must be held that there was
an agreement in writing between the parties in that regard.
The
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

said judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was specifically
approved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its subsequent above-
mentioned decision reported in 2010(1) - SCALE - 57 (Trimex
International FZE Limited, Dubai vs. Vendata Aluminium
Ltd.).

21.k. In another decision reported in (2009) 2 - S.C.C. -
134 (
Shakti Bhog Foods Ltd. vs. Kola Shipping Ltd.
), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:-

"The existence of an arbitration agreement can be
inferred from a document signed by the parties, or an
exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of
telecommunication, which provide a record of the
agreement".

21.l. Therefore, the correspondence through email can be
considered as a valid binding agreement/contract between the
parties and hence, the contention of the Petitioner that Ex.P.76 is
only an e-mail sent through Excel Sheet cannot be accepted at all.
Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

22. The Tenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has not
taken into account that towards the Bank Guarantee
mobilization advance has been released and that the same has
not been completely recovered, which is contrary to terms of
contract.

22.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has referred
to Sl. No.9 at Page No. 18 of the Award. In the said page at Para
No. 29 the learned Arbitrator has mentioned the prayer in Claim
Petition as well as in the counter-claim of the Petitioner. There is
no discussion about the claims referred to in the said
paragraph. When such being the case the said ground is itself is
misconception of facts. Even otherwise, as mentioned above,
the Impugned Award is a Speaking Order. There are no grounds
to interfere the same. Hence, this ground is not available for the
Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.

23. The Eleventh ground is that the learned Arbitrator has
not considered the purport and impact of the issues framed
when the parties went to trial.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

23.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has drawn my
attention to Para No. 27 of the Impugned Award wherein the
learned Arbitrator has held that the parties have adduced
evidence consciously knowing the crux of the dispute, that after
having led the evidence consciously the burden of proof fails
into insignificance and has referred to a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has
argued that no such decision as mentioned by the learned
Arbitrator in the said paragraph. In fact, there is a mistake in
mentioning the citation and also names of the parties. The
principle of law as mentioned by the learned Arbitrator is well
settled. Such a principle is enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. -1960 - S.C. - 100
(
Narayan Bhagwantrao vs. Gopal Vinayak Gosavi And
Others
). When such being the case, the learned Advocate for
the Petitioner cannot find fault with the learned Arbitrator for
having mentioned an incorrect citation. Hence, this ground is
not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

24. The Twelfth ground is that the Rules of proceedings
laid down to prior to commencement of trial has unilaterally
changed at the time of the award by holding that the burden of
proof fails into insignificance at Para No. 27 of the award.

24.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that It is a matter of fact and record that the Respondent No.1
has not produced or led any evidence in respect of the claims,
that it is also a matter of fact and record that the Respondent
No.1 did not even produce the RA Bills before the Tribunal and,
in fact, they were got confronted by the Petitioner during cross-
examination of PW.1, that the principles as enshrined under

Section 101
of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 have not even
been applied by the Respondent No.1, that it is for the
Respondent No.1 to have led positive evidence that it had
discharged its obligations as required in terms of Ex.R.36 and
Ex.P.1, that even a thorough reading of the Affidavit in-lieu of
evidence filed by the Respondent No.1 would establish that no
evidence is on record by the Respondent No.1 on this aspect,
that the principles enunciated in the Civil Procedure Code and
the Indian Evidence Act are applicable to an arbitral
proceedings as
laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India
and various other Courts, that it is therefore required that the
Tribunal applies the principles enunciated under Section 101 to
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

104 ought to have been discharged by Respondent No.1, that
therefore, the burden of proof that the bills were submitted in
the required manner and complied with Ex.R.36 is entirely on
the Respondent No.1 which has not been discharged, that the
burden of proof also vested with the Respondent No.1 since
failure to prove the above facts would result in a failure of the
Respondent No.1's claim, that the aspect of whether the bills
had been submitted in the required format with the required
enclosures is in the sole custody and prerogative of Respondent
No.1 , that the Respondent No.1 not having led any evidence in
this regard has failed in discharging its burden of proof, that this
crucial aspect has also been ignored by the Tribunal, that in
spite of the same having been argued, brought to the notice of
the Tribunal and the Tribunal having recorded the same from
Para 12 Page 7 to Para 20 Page 12 of the Impugned Order, that
Tribunal has misdirected itself as regards the role of CBRE,
being a PMC and adverted to the document relating to
appointment of CBRE and has given a finding that CBRE is the
lawful custodian of the original RA Bills, that Tribunal has not
given any finding as to whether the Respondent No.1 has
discharged its obligations and the demands made by the PMC.

24.b. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has relied on
a decision reported in (2011) 12 - S.C.C. - 220 (Rangammal
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

vs. Kuppusamy and another), wherein it is held that the

Indian Evidence Act, 1872
has clearly laid down that the burden
of proving the fact always lies upon a person who asserts it,
that unless such burden is discharged, the other party is not
required to be called upon to prove its case, that the court has
to examine as to whether the person upon whom the burden
lies has been able to discharge its burden, that unless he
arrives at such a conclusion, he cannot proceed on the basis of
weakness of the other party. Relying on the said decision, the
learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued that this
principle has also been ignored by the Tribunal.

24.c. He has further argued that the Tribunal applied a
wrong position of law to the present case thereby rendering the
entire award, contrary to fundamental public policy of the
country, that such a wrong finding has resulted in the Tribunal
committing a further illegality of passing an award in favour of
the Respondent.

24.d. I have discussed about this aspect while answering
ninth ground above. In fact, the learned Arbitrator after
discussing the contentions and arguments of both parties, has
discussed at Para No. 26 at Page No.16 of the Award, that the
Petitioner has denied the receipt of Ex.P.76/RA Bill No.5, that
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Ex.P.76 was submitted with an e-mail letter dated 06.12.2013,
in respect work executed during the period from 24.09.2013 to
30.11.2013, that as per Ex.R.91, CBRE alone was expected to
be verified the RA Bills and to make certification recommending
for payment, that if RA Bill No.5 is not processed through the
PMC then the best person who could have spoken about the
non-submission of Ex.P.76 is the engineer or official of CBRE and
in view of the non-examination of the said engineer and official
and in view of the receipt of Ex.P.76 is not seriously disputed in
the evidence of RW.1, he has answered Issue No.5 in the
Affirmative. When such being the case, the said finding cannot
be considered as perverse or illegal. Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

25. The Thirteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator
has not examined whether the 1st Respondent has submitted
the running bills in the required form with all supporting
documents.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

25.a.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

26. The Fourteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator
has blindly awarded amounts more than claimed and rejected
the deductions made by the PMC without any basis.

26.a.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re-appreciate and re-evaluate
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

27. The Fifteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has
not referred to the cross-examination of PW.1 thereby rendering
the entire cross-examination otiose.

27.a.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

28. The Sixteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator has
turned the law of evidence by holding that the Petitioner ought
to have led the evidence of PMC to enable the Respondent No.1
to post questions in the cross-examination of said PMC, that the
said finding being contrary to the legal aspects.

28.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect
while answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same
it is to be noted that Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-appreciate and re-
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

29. The Seventeenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator
has ignored the fact that if at all the 1 st Respondent wanted to
lead evidence of PMC there was nothing preventing him for
summoning the said PMC as a witness.

29.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect
while answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same
it is to be noted that
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and
re-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal
and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

30. The Eighteenth ground is that the learned Arbitrator
has not considered that there were discrepancies in the
submission of RA Bills and that in spite of RA Bills having been
re-submitted several times, the discrepancies were not cleared.

30.a.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

31. The Nineteenth ground is that until the submission of
RA Bill with all requirements satisfying the terms of the
contract, Ex.R.36, the submissions could not be held to be
complete and proper.

31.a. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect
while answering twelfth ground above. In addition to the same
it is to be noted that
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and
re-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal
and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

32. The Twentieth ground is that the learned Arbitrator
has treated both the parties unequally by permitting the 1 st
Respondent to produce documents after completion of evidence
and rejected the similar prayer of the Petitioner.

32.a. By elaborating the arguments on this ground, the
learned Advocate for the Petitioner has also relied on a decision
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

reported in 2008 (13) - S.C.C. - 80 (
DDA vs. R.S. Sharma &
Co.
), and has argued that the learned Arbitrator has not given
equal treatment to both parties. On perusal of the Arbitral
Records, the learned Arbitrator has recorded the evidence of
PW.1 on behalf of the 1st Respondent and RW.1 and 2 on behalf
of the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent has produced Ex.P.1 to
Ex.P.117 and the Petitioner has produced Ex.R.1 to Ex.R.94. The
learned Arbitrator has considered the said oral and
documentary evidence in the Impugned Award. Just because he
has not permitted the Petitioner to produce additional
documents as prayed by him in the Application dated
16.04.2015, as per the Orders dated 05.06.2015, it cannot be
considered that the learned Arbitrator has not given equal
treatment to both parties. In order to find out the equal
treatment the entire proceedings conducted by the learned
Arbitrator has to be taken into consideration. When such being
the case the said contention of the Petitioner cannot be
accepted. Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner
under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by
the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on
this ground is thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

33. The Twenty First ground is that the learned Arbitrator
on the one hand has held that the adhoc payment advice of the
PMC is certification thereby holding that the Petitioner had to
make payments to the 1st Respondent in terms thereof and on
the other hand indicates that the deduction made by the PMC
without any reasoning, basis or evidence on record.

33.a. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-
appreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned
Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

34. The Twenty Second ground is that the mere reading
of Issue No.5 that it is for the 1 st Respondent to prove that RA
Bills were submitted as per the required format agreed upon
that all the supporting documents required to be submitted as
agreed upon between the parties, and that if the same had not
been submitted as per Item No. 4 and 5 of Ex.P.1 and the
extracted portion of Ex.R.6 had not been complied, there was a
violation and Issue No.5 ought to have been answered in favour
of the Petitioner.

34.a. In fact, this ground is in the nature and tenor of
appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-
appreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned
Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

35. The Twenty Third ground is that a mere perusal of the
appreciation of Issue No.5 at Para No.11 Page No. 6 to Para
No.27 at Page No.17 would establish that the learned Arbitrator
has not applied the terms of the contract while dealing with the
said issue.

35.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that a mere perusal of the appreciation of Issue No.5 would
categorically and unimpeachably establish that the Tribunal has
not applied the terms of the contract while dealing with
appreciating the said issue, that the Tribunal though at Para
No.11 Page No. 7 extracted the requirements no finding has
been given in respect of the said requirements.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

35.b. So far as the interpretation of terms of contracts by
the learned Arbitrator, I have already discussed while answering
twelfth ground above. For the same reasons, the contentions of
the Petitioner on this ground also cannot be accepted. Hence,
this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section
(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

36. The Twenty Fourth ground is that instead of
examining the requirements under Ex.R.36, the learned
Arbitrator has misdirected as regards the role of PMC and
adverted to the document relating to appointment of CBRE and
has given a finding that CBRE is the lawful custodian of the RA
Bills.

36.a. About this ground, the learned Advocate for the
Petitioner has argued about the burden of proof lies on the 1 st
Respondent since failure to prove the said aspect would result
in a failure of the claim of the 1 st Respondent, that the aspect of
whether the bills had been submitted in the require enclosures
is in the sole custody and prerogative of the 1 st Respondent,
that the 1st Respondent not having led any evidence in this
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

regard has failed in discharging its burden of proof and this
aspect has been ignored by the learned Arbitrator. With this
background if this ground is read, this ground is in the nature
and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to
make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the
learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and
re-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal
and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

37. The Twenty Fifth ground is that at Para No.11 of the
award, the learned Arbitrator though refers to the letter dated
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

25.06.2013, calling upon the 1st Respondent to furnish
documents with the RA Bills he has not given any finding has to
whether the 1st Respondent has discharged its obligations and
demands made by the PMC.

37.a. About this ground, the learned Advocate for the
Petitioner has argued about the burden of proof lies on the 1 st
Respondent for production of RA Bills and satisfaction of the
requirements of Ex.R.36 and that this aspect has been ignored
by the learned Arbitrator. With this background if this ground is
read, this ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order
to answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the
evidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced
before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act is summary
in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

38. The Twenty Sixth ground is that at Para No. 12 to 19 of
the Award, though has referred to the dates of submission and
re-submission of the RA Bills, has not appreciated the fact that
such re-submissions were necessitated on account of improper
submissions and non-compliance of Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36.

38.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that it is a facts on record which cannot be ascertained by a
perusal of Ex.R.4, Ex.R.6, Ex.R.7 which are the copies of the Bills
obtained from the PMC which would categorically indicate and
establish that the requirement as stated in Ex.P.1 and Ex.R.36
had not been complied while submitting the RA Bills. With this
background if this ground is read, this ground is in the nature
and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to
make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the
learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and
re-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under

of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

39. The Twenty Seventh ground is that the learned
Arbitrator has completely misconstrued the recommendation
made by the PMC for adhoc payments to the certification of the
RA Bills.

39.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the 1st Respondent submitted insufficient, incomplete,
inadequate false bills, that the said bills were returned from
time to time by the PMC, that with an intention to keep the
works going and not to cause stoppage of work, the PMC had
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

recommended certain adhoc payments, that such
recommendation does not amount to certification of the RA
Bills, that none of the RA Bills has been certified by the PMC and
that there is no such certification on record.
In support of said
arguments, he has relied on the decision reported in 2009 (2) -
S.C.C. - 606 (
U.P. State Electricity Board and Another vs.
Aziz Ahamad
), wherein it is held that pleadings are required to
be proved by leading evidence. The learned counsel submitted
that where evidence is not led by a party in support of the
pleadings no reliance can be placed only on the pleadings
without there being any cogent evidence in support of the
pleadings.

39.b. In fact, I have already discussed about this aspect
while answering Ground No. 11 and 12 above. For the same
reasons, I cannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner.
Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

40. The Twenty Eighth ground is that the learned
Arbitrator has misapplied in holding that the claim of Rs.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

3,31,03,442/- is towards the work done in terms of the contract,
that the said claim is on account of interest and idle charges,
loss of material, bank guarantee etc.

40.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has drawn my
attention to the table reproduced by the Tribunal at Page No. 18
of the Award and has argued that the same would indicate that
the said claim is an account of interest and idle charges,
demurrage, loss of material, bank guarantee etc., that the claim
as regards the work done is only at Sl. No.1 at Page No. 18 for
the balance for Rs. 91,83,693/-.

40.b. On perusal of said table along with the submission of
the Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, in order to answer
this ground, I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence
adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced
before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act is summary
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

41. The Twenty Ninth ground is that the reasoning given
by the Tribunal establishes that instead of ascertaining whether
the 1st Respondent has proved its case, the Tribunal has sought
to ascertain the veracity of the defence of the 1 st Respondent.

41.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Tribunal has patently erred and has not adopting a
judicial approach while dealing with the question, it has ignored
most material evidence has not applied its mind to all the
relevant facts and circumstances, that the Tribunal has not
adopted a judicial approach, has completely ignored this
evidence, that the Tribunal has completely failed to adopt a
judicial approach while dealing with Issue No. 1 to 3, has acted
arbitrarily, capriciously, ignored material pieces of evidence and
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

has not at all applied its mind to all the material on record, that
the award suffers from patent errors and contradictory.

41.b. If this ground is read, it is about the allegation against
the learned Arbitrator about the appreciation of evidence at
Issue No. 1 to 3 and hence, this ground is in the nature and
tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make
re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned
Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

42. The Thirtieth ground is that the entire reasoning as
regards the submissions of bill and required format at Para No.
33 and 34 of the Award is misconceived and contrary to the
facts on record, that the findings is on the basis of inferences by
the Tribunal rather than on the basis of facts and documents,
that the recommendation made for adhoc payment by PMC has
been regarded to be certification by the Tribunal which is
contrary to the records.

42.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Tribunal committed manifest and grave error by
holding that the 1st Respondent is lawful custody of all the
documents and the certificate, that the assertions have been
made by the 1st Respondent, it was for the 1st Respondent to
prove these facts and assertions, that the Tribunal having
accepted that the revised bill was submitted on 24.06.2013
could not have taken any other date for the purpose of arriving
at the date of payment, that having considered that the bill was
submitted on 24.06.2013, the Tribunal ought to have
ascertained whether bill was in the form agreed between the
parties, that the Tribunal has disregarded the assertion made by
the 1st Respondent in his pleadings as also in evidence that the
payment were made in adhoc manner for going on with the
work and not to effect the work at site.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

42.b. If this ground is read, it is about the allegation against
the learned Arbitrator about the appreciation of evidence about
the revised bill submitted on 24.06.2013 and hence, this ground
is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this
ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced
before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-
appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the
Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the
Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have

(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.
Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the
Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

43. The Thirty First ground is that the Tribunal at Para No.
34 commits a grave error by referring to an I.A. filed by the 1 st
Respondent on 16.04.2015 under which the 1 st Respondent had
sought for certain documents as if to hold that the 1 st
Respondent is required to produce documents when in fact the
Tribunal has dismissed the said application by way of its Order
dated 05.06.2015.

43.a. I have already discussed about this aspect while
answering twentieth ground above. For the same reasons, I
cannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

44. The Thirty Second ground is that the findings of the
Tribunal at Para No 35 that the inadequacy pointed out by CBRE
to the 1st Respondent were complied with while furnishing
remaining bills is contrary to those remaining bills.

44.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the inadequacy continued in the remaining bills, that
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

having arrived at a conclusion that there were inadequacies in
RA Bill No.1, that the Tribunal could not have held that there
was delay on the part of the Petitioner in making payments of
money, that the finding that there were separate adhoc
recommendation and certification is not borne out by any
records.

44.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of
the Tribunal about the inadequacy pointed out by the CBRE
while furnishing remaining bills and hence, this ground is in the
nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I
have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before
the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-
appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the
Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the
Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have
repeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine
the correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were
sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings
under
Section 34
of the Act is summary in nature as held in the
decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =
(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.
Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.

45. The Thirty Third ground is that at Para No. 36, the
Tribunal committed grave errors in holding that the adhoc
recommendation was a final certification and by accepting the
contention of the 1st Respondent that the sum of Rs. 9,61,906/-
which was withheld could not have been withheld.

45.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Tribunal has not referred Ex.R.6, Ex.R.7, Ex.R.11 in
respect of the said aspect, that thus the finding that a sum of
Rs. 28,63,944/- was due from the Petitioner, to the 1 st
Respondent is bereft of any merits and contrary to any records,
that there is no basis for the same and such a finding is
contrary to the contractual document available before the
Tribunal, that the Tribunal could not have gone beyond the
contract to arrive at such a finding, that the Tribunal had a duty
to implement the contract as it is and not on the basis of any
inferences.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

45.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of
the Tribunal about the withholding of sum of Rs.9,61,906/- by
the Petitioner and hence, this ground is in the nature and tenor
of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to make re-
appreciation of the evidence adduced before the learned
Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

46. The Thirty Fourth ground is that the finding at Para
No. 37 relating to RA Bill 3 is contrary to the records and the
contract.

46.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Tribunal having observed that the RA Bill No.3 was
raised for an amount Rs. 73,85,862/- but final certification was
made for Rs. 15,18,466/- would itself establishes the malafides
on the part of the 1st Respondent which the Tribunal ought to
have taken note of, that on the one hand the Tribunal contends
that the payment advice is certification and it has to be
accepted in totality and on the other hand the Tribunal has
sought to find faults with the said payment advice, that the
Tribunal ought not to have traveled beyond the references
made and the contentions urged to arrive such a finding, that
this being without prejudice to the fact that there was no
certification was made by the PMC and all these payments were
adhoc payments and further even while recommending
payments it had been categorically stated that the required
documents have not been submitted with the bills.

46.b. I have already discussed about adhoc payment
certification by PMC while answering earlier grounds. I need not
prolong my discussion to avoid repetition. For the same
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

reasons, I cannot accept the said contentions of the Petitioner.
Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

47. The Thirty Fifth ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal at Para No. 38 relates to RA Bill 4 that the same was
initially raised for Rs. 98,06,902/- and submitted to CBRE on
09.10.2013 and according to the Tribunal the same was
certified by PMC on 11.11.2013 for a sum of Rs. 35,03,878/-,
that the Tribunal comes to wrong conclusion that in the said
payment advice a sum of Rs. 31,43,813/- is stated to have been
paid.

47.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that all these findings are dehors the documents on evidence
on record and or not supported by any evidence, that in the
table made out by the Tribunal the due amount is at Rs.
1,30,62,320/- on account of RA Bill No.1 to 4, that this amount is
even more than what is claimed by the 1 st Respondent, that this
itself would indicate that the RA Bills submitted by the 1 st
Respondent were completely confusing, not proper and do not
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

satisfy the requirements of the contract, that the finding of the
Tribunal in respect of RA Bill No. 1 to 4 is a baseless inference
and presumption on part of the Tribunal.

47.b. If this ground is read, it is about the appreciation of
the Tribunal about the RA Bill No. 1 to 4 and hence, this ground
is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this
ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced
before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-
appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the
Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the
Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have
repeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to examine

under
Section 34

(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.
Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the
Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

48. The Thirty Sixth ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal at Para No. 39 that Ex.R.11 is a Bill containing
voluminous documents submitted by the 1 st Respondent is
false.

48.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Tribunal has ignored the fact that the 1 st Respondent
has not produced any documentary evidence which would
support the claim of any amounts as claimed by the 1 st
Respondent, that Ex.R.11 was submitted by the 1 st Respondent
but was confronted to the witness of the 1 st Respondent by the
Petitioner, that while dealing with the aspects the deductions
made by the Tribunal instead of referring documents on record
again misapplied itself thereby misdirecting itself by holding
that any aspect relating to this evidence ought to have been led
by the Petitioner through PMC, that the Tribunal failed to take
note of the fact that the 1st Respondent by not leading any
evidence had not discharge the burden that it had carried out
the works in a proper manner, that instead the Tribunal
wrongfully shifted the burden on the Petitioner which could not
be done under law, that though the Tribunal holds that the
inadequacy and deficiency ought to have been made note of in
the daily progress report and the minutes of meeting, the
Tribunal has not considered the deduction made by CBRE itself,
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

it is not in dispute that CBRE had made such deduction, that the
Tribunal again misdirected itself by holding that the CBRE ought
to have made note of it on the daily progress report when in
fact daily progress report were submitted by the 1 st Respondent
and not prepared by CBRE, that the various minutes of meeting
have categorically referred to the inadequacy of works carried
out by the 1st Respondent and have not been looked into and
have been ignored by the Tribunal, that the documentary
evidence being on record, the Tribunal misapplied itself by
holding that the Engineers of the Petitioner ought to have been
examined, that the examination or otherwise of Mr. G. Ethiraj
as a witness has nothing to do with the matter when the
documents were on record and the correspondences on record
indicated and established the facts, that it was for the 1 st
Respondent to establish that it had carried out the works in a
proper and required manner.

48.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the
Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the
appreciation of the Tribunal about Ex.R.11 and hence, this
ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer
this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence
adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced
before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act is summary
in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

49. The Thirty Seventh ground is that the finding a Para
No. 43 by the Tribunal is contradictory, that on the one hand it
holds that the dewatering system was place and the works was
going on as usual and on the other hand refers to CBRE
instructions to repair the damaged header lines.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

49.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that if the header lines were damaged, the question of
dewatering system working would not at all arise, that the
Minutes of Meeting of 11.10.2013 were much after the 1 st
Respondent abandoned the site on 18.09.2013, that the Daily
Progress Report of 16 to 19 and 21.10.2013 do not include
reference to any work done by the 1 st Respondent, that the
Tribunal has misdirected itself as regards this document.

49.b. If this ground is read and the above arguments of the
Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding
of the Tribunal in respect of Minutes of Meeting and the damage
caused to dewatering system and hence, this ground is in the
nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I
have to make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before
the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-
appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the
Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the
Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have

decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 =
(2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M.
Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not available for the
Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.

50. The Thirty Eighth ground is that the Tribunal
misapplied itself in Para No. 44 by holding that the CBRE would
incorporate the deficiency in daily progress report will in fact
daily progress report were submitted by the 1 st Respondent and
not prepared by CBRE.

50.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the entire reasoning in Para No.44 is contrary to evidence
and contract between the parties, that it is not understood as to
on what basis the Tribunal has concluded that nothing escaped
the watchful eyes of the Engineers at site, that work was going
on at multiple places and the engineers were to supervise each
and every work, all the time they were at site to broadly
manage the work, that the said engineers were not preparing
any daily progress report, that the works done had to be
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

certified by CBRE by furnishing necessary measurement sheets
and documents which were not so furnished.

50.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the
Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding
of the Tribunal in respect of the Daily Progress Reports and
hence, this ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order
to answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the
evidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced

Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (

Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

51. The Thirty Ninth ground is that the Tribunal without
even considering the documentary evidence on record has
come to a wrongful conclusion that an engineer of CBRE or
Petitioner was to have been examined in the matter.

51.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and

). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

52. The Fortieth ground is that the Tribunal has wrongly
come to a conclusion that PW.1 is a highly qualified person
having rich experience in pile foundation when in fact the works
carried out as also his cross-examination would establish
otherwise.

52.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and

). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

53. The Forty First ground is that the Tribunal has not even
looked into the cross-examination PW.1.

53.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

54. The Forty Second ground is that it is not known on
what basis the Tribunal at Para No. 46 of the Award come to a
conclusion that 32 dewatering pumps had been installed by the
1st Respondent when in fact as per the records only 32 number
of pumps had been installed.

54.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the records which had been marked by the 1 st Respondent
and produced along with RA Bill No. 3 and 4 would categorically
and unimpeachably establish that the DG sets were switched off
and not working, that when the DG sets were not working, the
pumps automatically switching on would not arise at all and
hence the said finding is contrary to evidence and contractual
agreement between the parties.

54.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the
Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding
of the Tribunal in respect of 32 dewatering pumps and hence,
this ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to
answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the
evidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of
the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced
before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under

of the Act is summary
in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

55. The Forty Third ground is that the Tribunal has also
ignored several correspondences made by the Petitioner and
the PMC which were on record.

55.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his

of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

56. The Forty Fourth ground is that the Tribunal has
misapplied and misdirected itself by holding that water gushed
from Mantri Flora side when in fact water accumulated in the
property of Mantri Flora on account of the improper works
carried out by the 1st Respondent which has been accepted and
observed by an independent surveyor.

56.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the an insurance surveyor was appointed by the insurance
company in terms of Ex.R.112, that the reports submitted
though available with the 1 st Respondent, the same was
suppressed by him, that the sewage pipe on which is on the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

eastern side as nothing to do with the damaged caused on the
western side, they being on opposite ends and separated by
more than 330 feet, that the Tribunal has completely misapplied
itself and it appears that the facts have not been understood by
the Tribunal.

56.b. If this ground is read and the above argument of the
Advocate for the Petitioner is concerned, it is about the finding
of the Tribunal in respect of the direction of the sewage pipe as
observed by the Tribunal and hence, this ground is in the nature
and tenor of appeal. In order to answer this ground I have to
make re-appreciation of the evidence adduced before the
learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and
re-evaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal
and thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the

of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

57. The Forty Fifth ground is that the Tribunal has
misdirected itself while appreciating Ex.P.111 being the letter
dated 04.09.2013, sent by Mr. G Ethiraj to Mantri Flora
Complex.

57.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that it is a matter of fact and record that the Petitioner was
supporting the claim of the 1st Respondent in all manner
possible in respect of the insurance claim and that the
Petitioner was acting as per the information and instructions
provided by 1st Respondent, that the statements made both by
1st Respondent and the Petitioner have been considered by an
independent insurance surveyor and the said surveyor has
submitted his report after having conducted an analysis of the
works done whereas the letters at Ex.P.111 and Ex.P.114 were
issued on the basis of instructions and information of the 1 st
Respondent, that an expert in the field, appointed by the
insurance company, having come to a conclusion that the works
carried out by the Respondent No.1 were improper, not in
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

accordance with the drawings as also the Engineering practice,
the report of the insurance surveyor ought to have been
accepted by the Tribunal, more so, when such a finding as not
been challenged by the insured, i.e. the 1 st Respondent from
2014 till the date of award, that admittedly no steps have been
taken by the 1st Respondent to challenge the report which
would lease to an inescapable conclusion, that the report is
accepted by the 1st Respondent, that the report being
subsequent to letters at Ex.P.111 and Ex.P.114, the question of
the subsequent report being watered down by earlier letters
would not at all arise, more so, when Ex.P.111 has been
considered by the Insurance Surveyor.

57.b. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has
argued that the dispute arose between the parties after the
mishap which happened on the intervening night of the 3 rd and
4th September 2013, when a portion of the compound wall of
Mantri Flora collapsed due to heavy rains causing damage to
dewatering system and 64 piles, that in relation to which the 1 st
Respondent had taken a CAR Policy (Ex.P.115), that the
Ex.P.111/Letter of Petitioner through Sri. G Ethiraj dated
04.09.2013, which also forms part of Ex.P.115, clearly states
that the mishap happened on account of overflow on the
western side, undertaking the existing foundation, that the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

RW.2 submitted a report and as per that report he has
categorically admitted that the work executed by 1 st
Respondent was in order and deflection of the piles on western
side was on account of the sudden gush of water on the Mantri
side, that having regard to the evidence of RW.2, on material
aspects has supported the case of the 1 st Respondent and there
can be no doubt about the quality of the work done by the 1 st
Respondent, that the Petitioner who had admitted its liability in
the Ex.R.60/Letter dated 09.12.2013, had taken a U-Turn after
the loss assessed by the Surveyor, who had opined that it was a
result of bad engineering obviously referring to Ex.R.5, that
according to surveyor the piles were embedded in loose soil
instead of rock, that the letter dated 04.09.2013 written by the
Petitioner (through Sri. Ethiraj to Mantri Flora) is a part of
Ex.P.115 and was referred to by the surveyor to prima facie
come to the conclusion that it was open to the Petitioner to
proceed against Mantri Flora and not against the Insurance
company, that however the surveyor found that the claim of the
insured for damage caused to 64 pile beams is established, but
turned down on the basis of the letter dated 04.09.2013.

57.c. This ground is more or less similar to that of Ground
No. 36. I have discussed about the contentions of both parties,
while answering Ground No. 36. Hence for the same reasons, I
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

cannot accept the contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

58. The Forty Sixth ground is that the Tribunal has
apparently arrived at a conclusion that the letter was sent post
collapse of the compound wall since the letter is dated
04.09.2013 and according to the 1st Respondent compound wall
collapsed in the night of 03.09.2013, when in fact the collapse
happened on 14.09.2013.

58.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the finding of the Tribunal at Para No. 49 Page No. 31 of the
Award is extremely contradictory and does not make any sense,
that it is not known as to how the independent insurance
surveyor's report Ex.R.12 dated 28.02.2014 could be watered
down by Ex.P.111 dated 04.09.2013 and / or the Ex.P.114/letter
dated 26.02.2014, which were prior to Ex.R.12.

58.b. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has
argued that it is submitted that the Petitioner was also
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

questioning the competence of the surveyor as to the findings
recorded by him, that in fact the Petitioner has addressed
Ex.P.114/ Letter to the higher authorities of the Claims Hubs of
Insurance Company wherein the Petitioner has stated that the
rejection of the claim by the surveyor is not correct and that the
work carried out by the 1 st Respondent is correct in all respects,
that the Petitioner having stated in Ex.P.114 that the surveyors
report is wrong cannot now rely on it to blame the 1 st
Respondent to any extent, that the question of the liability of
the insurer is not a closed chapter, that it is even now open to
the Petitioner to proceed against the insurance company and
recover the amounts.

58.c. This Ground is more or less similar to Ground No. 44,
wherein both parties have argued about Ex.P.114. This is only
further contention about the appreciation of the Ex.P.114 by the
Tribunal. When such being the case, the said contention of the
Petitioner is not accepted for the same reasons given while
answering Ground No. 44. Hence, this ground is not available
for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the
challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside
of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and rejected.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

59. The Forty Seventh ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal in respect of alleged RA Bill No.5 at Para No. 56 and 27
at Page No. 37 - 38 of the Award or contradictory.

59.a. I have already discussed about the finding and
observation of the Tribunal about RA Bill No.5 while answering
Ground Nos . 9 and 12 above. For the same reasons I cannot
accept the said arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner.
Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

60. The Forty Eighth ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal that in terms of Ex.P.73 there was unequivocal
indication that the Petitioner owed monies to the 1 st Respondent
prior to mishap and had assured release the same and
therefore it was a justified demand is contrary to the evidence
on record.

60.a. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has argued
that the Ex.P.73/ Minutes of Meeting dated 11.10.2013, which is
much subsequent to the mishap which according to the 1 st
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Respondent occurred on 03.09.2013, and according to the
Petitioner occurred on 13.09.2013, that therefore Ex.P.73 being
a demand of dues prior to the mishap is false, that Ex.P.73 does
not speak of the quantum of money and hence that cannot be a
demand as regards the dues as construed by the Tribunal.

60.b. I have already discussed about the observation and
finding of the Tribunal in respect of Ex.P.73, while answering
Ground No.37. For the same reasons I cannot accept the said
arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner. Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

61. The Forty Ninth ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal at Para No. 66 and 67 as regards the rain is again
misconceived.

61.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

62. The Fiftieth ground is that the finding of the Tribunal
that the sewage line on the eastern side and permitted rain on
the western side negated to the adjoining residential complex is
not supported by any evidence on record.

62.a. If this ground is read, it is in the nature and tenor of
appeal.
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996
does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate
the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and
thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held that
it is not permissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the
findings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his
findings. The nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act
is summary in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019)

- S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462
(
Canara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this
ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2)
and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration &
Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

63. The Fifty First ground is that the finding of the Tribunal
that Ex.R.2 was incomplete and second opinion report of
Geocon resulted in descoping of excavation work is not
supported by any evidence on record.

63.a. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has
argued that it was pointed out that the Petitioner has misled all
the parties concerned, while it served Ex.R.2/Soil Test Report,
that due to the own acts of Petitioner delay has occasioned.
Elaborating his arguments he has drawn my attention to the
following aspects:-
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

a) Delay in marking of the piles by 11 days and in relation
to which several correspondences have taken place between
the 1st Respondent and PMC.

b) Delay in taking decision about the piling work to be
taken or not in so far as the south western side (curved
portion). Initially there was a Meeting between the Petitioner/
PMC/ MCPL/ 1st Respondent on 09.05.2013, wherein Sri. Sailesh
Mahimthura suggested that to ascertain the Rock Profile of the
south western portion, pits have to be dug, that it was pointed
out by the 1st Respondent on 10.05.2013 itself as could be seen
from Ex.P.27 and Ex.P.83, that if the suggestion of Sri. Sailesh
Mahimthura were to be followed, it would virtually make it
impossible to carry out piling work in the South-Western side,
that Ex.R.76 records the visit of Sri. Sailesh Mahimthura to the
site on 27.06.2013.

He has drawn my attention to Item No.1 of Ex.R.76, which
reads as follows:-

General Excavation details to be followed at (besides
Curved ramp, where micro pilling not carried out) southern side.
MCPL informed that adjacent to curve portion short creating as
well as Soil nailing not required. MCPL will send the general
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

excavation details by next week. Action by MCPL, Target date
04.07.2013'
By drawing my attention to the same, he has argued that
the above minutes of the meeting makes it amply clear MCPL,
has taken nearly 54 days to decide on the need of piling, soil
nailing, short-creating on the south-western side (curved
portion), that the time taken by MCPL to decide upon the said
issue cannot be attributed to the 1 st Respondent.

c) On the Eastern side of the site, a sewage line was
situated in the land in question, very near to the Trinity Acres
and Woods, which was not shown during the time of negotiation
and came to the knowledge of the 1 st Respondent later, that it is
submitted that Ex.R.5 was not given to the 1 st Respondent by
the Petitioner, during the negotiation process or at the time of
LOI, that it was furnished to the 1st Respondent at the time of
making of the site for location of pile bearing, that is was only
when the drawing at Ex.R.5 was furnished to the 1 st Respondent
the 1st Respondent came to know about the existence of the
sewerage line on the eastern side of the property, since there is
description in Ex.R.5, about the existence of the sewerage line,
that the sewage line was weak and broke down during the time
of execution of work by the 1st Respondent and prevented the
work being carried by 1st Respondent, that the compound wall
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

of Trinity Wood and Acres fell down, which also hampered the
progress of work, that several times the Petitioner and PMC
were informed about the leakage of the sewer line on the
Eastern side and that remedial measures have to be taken up,
that neither the Petitioner nor the PMC paid any attention to the
said fact, that the 1st Respondent had to spend substantial
amounts for repair of the same, the suggestion of suggesting a
contractor for replacing the sewer line was ruled out by the
Petitioner, that the 1st Respondent was left to spend for itself in
so far as the sewer line is concerned.

63.b. By considering the said arguments of the learned
Advocate for the 1st Respondent, I am of the opinion that this
ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In order to answer
this ground I have to make re-appreciation of the evidence
adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the
Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced
before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act is summary
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

64. The Fifty Second ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal at Para No. 80 that there was delay of 11 days in
marking the areas is contrary to the records.

64.a. The learned Advocate for the Respondent No.1 has
argued that the crux of the matter relates to the delay, that the
question is whether delay occasioned on account of the 1 st
Respondent or by the Petitioner, that 1st Respondent has not
committed any breach of LOI dated 15.03.2013 nor was it
responsible for delay in execution of the work, that having
regard to the circumstances mentioned in the Impugned Award
there is absolutely no delay on the part of the 1 st Respondent in
executing the work, that the delay is mainly attributed to the
Petitioner due to circumstances mentioned in the Impugned
Award couples with the fact that the Petitioner violated
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

payment in terms of Ex.P.1, Clause No.2.A cursory glance at
Ex.P.6, which is the payments details, would indicate that
Petitioner was deliberately delaying payment with a view to
gain time.

64.b. About this aspect, I have already discussed while
answering Ground No. 32. For the same reasons I cannot accept
the said contentions of the Petitioner. Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

65. The Fifty Third ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal that whenever the PMC insisted on the 1 st Respondent
to speed up work, the 1st Respondent had insisted for payment
of the amounts due to it immediately is also contrary to the
records.

65.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of appeal. In
order to answer this ground I have to make re-appreciation of
the evidence adduced before the learned Arbitrator.
Section 34

of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence
produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if
the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The
Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not permissible
to a Court to examine the correctness of the findings of the
arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The
nature of proceedings under
Section 34
of the Act is summary
in nature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.
Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (
Canara
Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala
). Hence, this ground is not
available for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-
section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act.
Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner calling for the
setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is thwarted and
rejected.

66. The Fifty Fourth ground is that the finding of the
Tribunal at Para No. 84 Page No. 58 and 59 that the Petitioner is
avoiding important and useful admissions in Ex.P.111, Ex.P.114,
Ex.R.60 etc., is without any basis.

66.a. I have already discussed about the Ex.P.111 and 114,
while answering Ground No. 46. For the same reasons I cannot
accept the said arguments of the Advocate for the Petitioner.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Hence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-
section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of
Section 34
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the Petitioner
calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is
thwarted and rejected.

67. The scope of this court is limited with regard to
Section 34

of the Act. The position of law stands crystallized today, that
findings, of fact as well as of law, of the arbitrator/Arbitral
Tribunal are ordinarily not amenable to interference under

Section 34
of the Act. The scope of interference is only where
the finding of the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the
contract between the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that
interference, by this court, is absolutely necessary. The
arbitrator is the final arbiter on facts as well as in law, and even
errors, factual or legal, which stop short of perversity, do not
merit interference under
Section 34
of the Act. The Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi in the decision reported in 2015 - S.C.C.
OnLine - Del - 13192 (P.C.L. Suncon (JV) vs. NHAI), in
Paragraph No. 24 has held as follows :-

"24. As a postscript, this Court believes that
it is imperative to sound a word of caution.
Notwithstanding the considerable jurisprudence
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

advising the Courts to remain circumspect in
denying the enforcement of arbitral awards,
interference with the awards challenged in the
petitions before them has become a matter of
routine, imperceptibly but surely erasing the
distinction between arbitral tribunals and courts.

Section 34
jurisdiction calls for judicial restraint
and an awareness that the process is removed
from appellate review. Arbitration as a form of
alternate dispute resolution, running parallel to
the judicial system, attempts to avoid the prolix
and lengthy process of the courts and
presupposes parties consciously agreeing to
submit a potential dispute to arbitration with the
object of actively avoiding a confrontation in the
precincts of the judicial system. If a court is
allowed to review the decision of the arbitral
tribunal on the law or on the merits, the speed
and, above all, the efficacy of the arbitral process
is lost."

68. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in
(2006) 11 - S.C.C. - 181 (
McDermott International Inc.
vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Ors.
), has held as follows :-

"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the
supervisory role of courts, for the review of the
arbitral award only to ensure fairness.
Intervention of the court is envisaged in few
circumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias
by the arbitrators, violation of natural justice,
etc. The court cannot correct errors of the
arbitrators. It can only quash the award leaving
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

the parties free to begin the arbitration again if
it is desired. So, scheme of the provision aims at
keeping the supervisory role of the court at
minimum level and this can be justified as parties
to the agreement make a conscious decision to
exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for
arbitration as they prefer the expediency and
finality offered by it."

69. Thus, it is observed and held that the arbitral award is
not marred by any patent illegality, as there is no contravention
of the substantive law of India, which would result in the death
knell of an arbitral award. It is also observed that there is no
patent illegality in the arbitral award, which must go to the root
of the matter. The arbitral award is also a well reasoned and a
speaking award. The arbitral award is also held to not be in
contravention of
Section 28(3)
of the Act, which pertains to the
terms of the contract, trade usages applicable to the nature of
contract and substance of dispute.

70.
The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015

made major changes to
Section 34
. The changes were
suggested by the 246th Report of the Law Commission of India
on Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of
August 2014 and the Supplementary to the 246th Report of the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Law Commission of India on Amendments to the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 of February 2015. These changes were
aimed at restricting Courts from interfering with arbitral awards
on the ground of "public policy." Accordingly, the amendment
added "Explanation 2" to
Section 34(2)
as well as Section 2A.
Explanation 2 of
Section 34(2)
states -

"For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether
there is a contravention with the fundamental policy of
Indian Law shall not entail a review on the merits of the
dispute."

71. Because of this amendment, Courts would no longer be
able to interfere with the award passed by the arbitrator. The
explanation makes it especially clear that in no way would a
Court be entailed to review the award on merits of the dispute.
The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has relied on a decision
reported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC vs. Saw Pipes
Limited). However, after amendment to
Arbitration and
Conciliation Act
, Section 2A also curtails the scope of
interpretation of "patently illegal" as propounded in the said
decision reported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC vs. Saw
Pipes Limited). Section 2A states :-

"An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other
than international commercial arbitrations, may also be
set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the award
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

is vitiate by patent illegality appearing on the face of
the award:

Provided that an award shall not be set aside
merely on the ground of an erroneous application of law
or by reappreciation of evidence."

72. Thus, Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or set
aside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has made
errors when dealing with the same.

73. Hence, the scope of interference is only where the finding
of the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the contract
between the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that interference, by
this court, is absolutely necessary. The Arbitrator is the final
arbiter on facts as well as in law, and even errors, factual or
legal, which stops short of perversity, does not merit
interference under
Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation
Act, 1996. Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or set
aside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has made
errors when dealing with the same. For the said aspect, the
learned Advocate for the Respondent has relied on a decision
reported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (
Navodaya Mass
Entertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines
).
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

74. Per-contra, the learned Advocate for the Petitioner has
relied on a decision reported in 2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49
(
Associate Builders vs. DDA
). The ratio of
the said decision

is to be appreciated along with the subsequent decisions of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court.

75. Subsequent to
the said decision
, In the decision reported
in (2017) 13 - SCALE - 91 (SC) (
Venture Global
Engineering LLC and Ors vs. Tech Mahindra Ltd. and
Ors
), the Hon'ble Supreme court has held as follows:-

"The Award of an Arbitral Tribunal can be set aside
only on the grounds specified in
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act and on no other ground.
The Court cannot act as an Appellate Court to examine
the legality of Award, nor it can examine the merits of
claim by entering in factual arena like an Appellate
Court."

76. A similar view is also taken in the decision reported in
(2017) 14 - SCALE - 240 (SC) (
Sutlej Construction vs. The
Union Territory of Chandigarh
).

77.
In the decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131
(
Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs.
National Highways Authority of India Ltd.
), the Hon'ble
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Supreme Court has once again reiterated the law related to the
examination by a Court of an Award under
Section 34
of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and has held as under:-

"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression
public policy of India, whether contained in
Section 34

or in
Section 48
, would now mean the fundamental
policy of Indian law as explained in paragraphs 18 and
27 of
Associate Builders
(supra), i.e., the fundamental
policy of Indian law would be relegated to the
"Renusagar" understanding of this expression.
This
would necessarily mean that the Western Geco (supra)
expansion has been done away with.
In short, Western
Geco (supra), as explained in paragraphs 28 and 29 of

Associate Builders
(supra), would no longer obtain, as
under the guise of interfering with an award on the
ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial
approach, the Court's intervention would be on the
merits of the award, which cannot be permitted post
amendment.

However, in so far as principles of natural
justice are concerned, as contained in
Sections 18
and

34(2) (a) (iii)
of the 1996 Act, these continue to be
grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in
paragraph 30 of
Associate Builders
(supra).

35. It is important to notice that the ground for
interference in so far as it concerns "interest of India"

has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer
obtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the
basis that the award is in conflict with justice or
morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the
"most basic notions of morality or justice". This again
would be in line with paragraphs 36 to 39 of
Associate
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Builders
(supra), as it is only such arbitral awards that
shock the conscience of the court that can be set aside
on this ground.

36. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now
constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is
contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as
understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of
Associate
Builders
(supra), or secondly, that such award is against
basic notions of justice or morality as understood in
paragraphs 36 to 39 of
Associate Builders
(supra).

Explanation 2 to
Section 34(2)(b)(ii)
and Explanation 2
to
Section 48(2)(b)(ii)
was added by the Amendment Act
only so that Western Geco (supra), as understood in

Associate Builders
(supra), and paragraphs 28 and 29 in
particular, is now done away with.

37. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are
concerned, an additional ground is now available under
subsection (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to

Section 34
.Here, there must be patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such
illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which
does not amount to mere erroneous application of the
law. In short, what is not subsumed within the
fundamental policy of Indian law, namely, the
contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or
public interest, cannot be brought in by the back door
when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground
of patent illegality.

38. Secondly, it is also made clear that re-

appreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate
court is permitted to do, cannot be permitted under the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the
award.

39. To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of
Associate
Builders
(supra), namely, a mere contravention of the
substantive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground
available to set aside an arbitral award.

Paragraph 42.2
of
Associate Builders
(supra), however, would remain,
for if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award and
contravenes
Section 31(3)
of the 1996 Act, that would
certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the
award.

40. The change made in
Section 28(3)
by the
Amendment Act really follows what is stated in
paragraphs 42.3 to 45 in
Associate Builders
(supra),
namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract
is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the
arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no
fair minded or reasonable person would; in short, that
the arbitrator's view is not even a possible view to take.
Also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and
deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an
error of jurisdiction. This ground of challenge will now
fall within the new ground added under
Section 34(2A)
.

41. What is important to note is that a decision
which is perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and
32 of
Associate Builders
(supra), while no longer being
aground for challenge under public policy of India,
would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing
on the face of the award. Thus, a finding based on no
evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence
in arriving at its decision would be perverse and liable
to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Additionally, a finding based on documents taken behind
the back of the parties by the arbitrator would also
qualify as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as
such decision is not based on evidence led by the
parties, and therefore, would also have to be
characterized as perverse."

78.
In the decision reported in 2019 (16) - SCALE - 823
(
Hindustan Construction Company Limited & Anr. vs.
Union of India & Ors.
), the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as
under:-

"49. Further, this Court has repeatedly held that an
application under
Section 34
of the Arbitration Act, 1996
is a summary proceeding not in the nature of a regular
suit -
see Canara Nidhi Ltd. v. M. Shashikala
2019 SCC
Online SC 1244 at paragraph 20.

As a result, a court
reviewing an arbitral award under
Section 34
does not
sit in appeal over the award, and if the view taken by
the arbitrator is possible, no interference is called for -

see Associated Construction v. Pawanhans Helicopters
Limited
. (2008)16 SCC 128 at paragraph 17.

50. Also, as has been held in the recent decision

Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI

2019 SCC Online SC 677, after the 2015 Amendment Act,
this Court cannot interfere with an arbitral award on
merits."

79. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision reported in
2020 - SCC Online - S.C. - 466 (
Patel Engineering Ltd. vs.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

North Eastern Power Corporation Ltd
) has once again
exposited the 'patent illegality' ground, appearing in
Section 34
(2A)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The most
significant part of this judgment is the recognition and re-
affirmation given to the test of patent illegality, as set out in
Paragraph (42.3) of the above-mentioned decision reported in
2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49 (
Associate Builders vs. DDA
) and
which was reiterated in Paragraph (40) of the decision reported
in 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131 (
Ssangyong Engineering &
Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of
India Ltd.
). The aforementioned test of 'patent illegality' lays
down that any contravention of
Section 28 (3)
of the Arbitration
& Conciliation Act, 1996 is deemed to be a sub-head of patent
illegality. According to it, an Arbitral Tribunal must decide in
accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an Arbitrator
construes a term of the contract in such a way that it could be
said to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person
could do, the same will render the award 'patently illegal'.

80. By keeping in mind about the said legal aspects, I am of
the opinion that the Arbitral Award is not marred by any patent
illegality, as there is no contravention of the substantive law of
India, which would result in the death knell of an Arbitral Award.
It is also observed that there is no patent illegality in the
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Arbitral Award, which must go to the root of the matter. The
Arbitral Award is also a well reasoned and a speaking award.
The Arbitral Award is also held to not be in contravention of

Section 28(3)
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, which
pertains to the terms of the contract, trade usages applicable to
the nature of contract and substance of dispute.

81. On a parting note, I would like to add, that the challenge
to the various clauses of contract by the Petitioner under the
present petition is not tenable. It is accordingly, held that the
Arbitral Award is neither against the fundamental policy of India
nor in contravention of law. Therefore, I find no perversity in
the Arbitral Award and the same is upheld.

82. Having given my careful consideration to the submissions
urged and the complete case record in the preceding
paragraphs of this judgment, I am of the view that is not a fit
and proper case for exercise the jurisdiction of this court under

Section 34
of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act and interfere
with the Arbitral Award and the same is upheld.

83. As far as reliance placed by the Learned Advocate for the
Petitioner on the recent judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

reported in 2021 - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 508 (
PSA Sical
Terminals Pvt. Ltd. vs. Board of Trustees of V.O.
Chidambranar Port Trust Tuticorin and Others
) is
concerned, the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that a decision,
which is perverse, though may not be a ground for challenge
under public policy of India, however, the same can certainly
amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the
award. The Hon'ble Apex Court has further held that a finding
based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital
evidence in arriving at its decision, would be perverse and liable
to be set aside.

84. In my humble opinion, it cannot be said, in the present
matter, that finding recorded by the Learned Arbitrator is based
on no evidence or it has ignored vital evidence before arriving
at the decision. A bare perusal of the award passed by the
Learned Arbitrator shows that evidence of both the parties
have been considered in detail and the Learned Arbitrator has
taken into account each and every submissions advanced by
the parties before him, including appreciation of evidence in
proper manner before arriving at the decision to pass the
impugned award and as such, the judgment cited by the
Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, is of little assistance to him.
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

85. For the said aspect, I wish to refer a recent decision of
the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2021) 3 - S.C.C. - 308
(Anglo American Metallurgical Coal Pty.
Ltd. vs. MMTC
Limited
), wherein it has laid down the parameters of judicial
review and Courts have been permitted to interfere only if there
is a ground of patent illegality or violation of fundamental policy
of Indian law and if a possible view is based on oral and
documentary evidence led in the case, which cannot be
characterized as being either perverse or being based on no
evidence and as such, no interference is permissible. The
relevant portion of the judgment is reproduced hereunder:-

"48. Given the parameters of judicial review

laid down in
Associate Builders, it is obvious that
neither the ground of fundamental policy of
Indian law, nor the ground of patent illegality,
have been made out in the facts of this case,
given the fact that the majority award is
certainly a possible view based on the oral and
documentary evidence led in the case, which
cannot be characterized as being either perverse
or being based on no evidence."

86. The learned Advocate for the 1st Respondent has relied on
a recent Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Delhi
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Airport Metro Express Private Limited vs. Delhi Metro
Rail Corporation Limited
in Civil Appeal No.5627/2021
(arising out of SLP (C) No. 4115/2019) decided on
09.09.2021. In
the said judgment
, the Arbitral Award which was
challenged before the Hon'ble High Court under
Section 34
was
dismissed and in appeal under
Section 37
. The Division Bench
of Hon'ble High Court has allowed the appeal and set aside the
award. In this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has set
aside the order of the Division Bench. In the said Judgment, the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para 24 has held as under:-

[

"24. This court has in several other judgments
interpreted
Section 34
of the 1996 Act to stress on the
restraint to be shown by courts while examining the
validity of the arbitral awards. The limited grounds
available to courts for annulment of arbitral awards are
well known to legally trained minds. However, the
difficulty arises in applying the well-established
principles for interference to the facts of each case that
come up before the courts. There is a disturbing
tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards, after
dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases
to come to a conclusion that the award needs
intervention and thereafter, dubbing the award to be
vitiated by either perversity or patent illegality, apart
from the other grounds available for annulment of the
award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the
objection of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to
preserve this court, which is minimal judicial
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several
judicial pronouncements of this court would become a
dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by
categorizing them as perverse or patently illegal
without appreciating the contours of the said
expressions."

87. The Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para 35 of the said
Judgment has held that as the arbitrator is the sole judge of the
quality as well as the quantity of the evidence, the task of being
a judge on the evidence before the Tribunal does not fall upon
the court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Section 34
. The
Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held in Para 39 of the said
Judgment that construction of the contract is within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal and merely because another view is
possible, the court cannot interfere with such construction and
substitute its own view.

88. On going through these Judgments, it makes further clear
that Arbitrator is sole judge of the quality and quantity of the
evidence and construction of contract is within the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal and the court cannot lightly interfere with the
award passed by the learned Arbitrator. On considering the
facts of the present case, as held in this Judgment there are no
grounds to set aside the award of the learned Arbitrator under
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

Section 34
of the Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in this
Judgment has even held that patent illegality which do not go to
the root of the matter and every error of law committed by the
Arbitral Tribunal could not fall within the expression patent
illegality.

89. Relying upon the law laid in the above-mentioned
decision reported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (
Navodaya
Mass Entertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines
), it can be
said that not only the reasoning of Arbitral Tribunal are logical,
but all the material and evidence were taken note of by Arbitral
Tribunal and this Court cannot substitute own evaluation of
conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclusion other than
that of Arbitral Tribunal. Cogent grounds, sufficient reasons
have been assigned by Arbitral Tribunal in reaching the just
conclusion and no error of law or misconduct is apparent on the
face of the record. This Court cannot re-appraise the evidence
and it is not open to this Court to sit in the appeal over the
conclusion/findings of facts arrived at by Arbitral Tribunal.
Re-

appraisal of the matter cannot be done by this Court. No error is
apparent in respect of the Impugned Award. I do not find any
contradiction in the observations and findings given by Arbitral
Tribunal. The Impugned Award does not suffer from vice of
Com.A.S.No.108/2017

irrationality and perversity. The conclusion of the Arbitral
Tribunal is based on a possible view of the matter, so the Court
is not expected to interfere with the award. Even impugned
award passed by Arbitral Tribunal cannot be set aside on the
ground that it was erroneous. The award is not against any
public policy nor against the terms of contract of the parties. No
ground for interference is made out. None of the grounds raised
by the petitioner attract
Section 34
of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act. Therefore, I answer this Point in Negative.

90. Point No. 2 :- Therefore, I proceed to pass the following
Order.
