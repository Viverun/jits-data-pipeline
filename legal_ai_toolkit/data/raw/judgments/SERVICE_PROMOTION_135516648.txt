given the directly recruited Motorman, the

the Motorman who did not opt for the merger,

As per the guidelines of the Railway Board,

turning down a promotion should have deprived

the applicants of MACP. However, as they

not a promotion but an option.

applicants are running Mumbai Suburban Trains in

highly dense network single handedly, while the

passengers Loco Pilot job (offered as option)

carries two persons sharing similar (or even

surprising that the respondents assumed that the

applicants were "reluctant to shoulder higher

experts in driving Suburban Trains and hence

desire to do the work at which they are best.

the Railway. In 2014, for the first time AVC

was brought on 02.06.2014. 7 Motormen exercised

option to opt in the combined cadre, later on

they withdrew their option and came in a

separate block.

SCC 116, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court in

Para 16 held as under:-

"16.
In
Union of India v. N. Murugesan
,
this Court pointed out that the phrases
"approbate" and "reprobate" mean that no
party can be allowed to accept and
reject the same thing, as the principle
behind the doctrine of election is in-

built in the concept of approbate and
reprobate, that is, a person cannot be
allowed to have the benefit of an
instrument while questioning the same.
It was noted that an element of fair
play is in-built in this principle and
it is a species of estoppel dealing with
the conduct of a party."

13.12. Mr.Shetty has placed reliance on the

judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

State of Tripura & Ors. Vs. Nikhil Ranjan

the applicants are governed by Para 140 of IREM.

Grade.

When a post (selection as well as non-

selection) is filled by considering staff of
different seniority units, the total length
of continuous service in the same or
equivalent grade held by the employees shall
be the determining factor for assigning
inter-seniority irrespective of the date of
confirmation of an employee with lesser
length of continuous service as compared to
another unconfirmed employee with longer
length of continuous service. This is
subject to the proviso that only non-

fortuitous service should be taken into
account for this purpose.

Note:- Non-fortuitous service means the
service rendered after the date of regular

while Para 140 of IREM deals it specifically with

promotion are Loco Pilot (Goods), Loco Pilot

which is Loco Pilot (Goods) with Grade Pay of

Rs.4200/- (Level-6) also contains that [(Motorman

22. The applicants have not challenged the

AVC dated 02.06.2014 issued by the General

Manager, Western Railway. Thus, the cause for

Page 69 of 78

70 OA No.1035/2022

& 908/2022

issue of provisional seniority list is AVC dated

02.06.2014 and Rule 140 of IREM and impugned

provisional seniority lists are only consequence

of it. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Amarjeet Singh and Others vs. Devi Ratan and

Others
, (2010) 1 SCC 417 has held that where the

promotions had been made by 2 different DPCs,

different rules and different criterion have not

been challenged the seniority list which is

consequential to the promotions could not be

challenged without challenging the promotions.

It will be helpful to extract the Paras 28 to 31

of the above judgment herein as under:-

"28. In the instant case, promotions had
been made by two different DPCs held on
19.12.1998 and 22.1.1999. Both DPCs had
made promotions under different Rules on
different criterion and their promotions
had been made with retrospective effect

with different dates notionally. In the
writ petition before the High Court, the
promotion of the appellants had not been
under challenge. The seniority which is
consequential to the promotions could

Page 70 of 78

71 OA No.1035/2022

not be challenged without challenging
the promotions. Challenging the
consequential order without challenging
the basic order is not permissible.

(
Vide P. Chitharanja Menon v. A.
Balakrishnan
).

29.

In
Roshan Lal v. International

Airport Authority of India the petitions
were primarily confined to the seniority
list and this Court held that challenge
to appointment orders could not be
entertained because of inordinate delay
and in absence of the same, validity of
consequential seniority could not be
examined. In such a case, a party is
under a legal obligation to challenge
the basic order and if and only if the
same is found to be wrong, consequential
orders may be examined..

30.
In
H.V. Pardasani v. Union of India

this Court observed that: (SCC p. 473,

by such adverse determination, their
ultimate claim to promotion would,
indeed, not succeed."

A similar view had been reiterated by
this Court in
Govt. of Maharashtra v.
Deokar

31. These appeals are squarely covered
by the aforesaid judgments. We are of
the considered opinion that in absence
of challenge to the promotion of the
appellants, relief of quashing the
consequential seniority list could not
have been granted."

23. Therefore, the claim of the applicants

cannot be sustained. The post of CLI for which

the claim is being made is a Supervisory post for

which the feeder cadre are Loco Pilots as well as

Motorman. While the Rule 140 of IREM

specifically deals with Drivers and Loco Running

Supervisors, Rule 320 is a general rule which

provides that when a post (selection as well as

non-selection) is filled by considering staff of

considered for promotion occurs on the date of

& 908/2022

consideration of eligible candidates. For the

sake of convenience, para Nos.82.2 to 85.1 of the

judgement are extracted herein as under:

"82.2 It is now a settled proposition of law that a candidate has
a right to be considered in the light of the existing rules, which
implies the "rule in force" as on the date consideration takes
place. The right to be considered for promotion occurs on the
date of consideration of the eligible candidates.

82.3 The Government is entitled to take a conscious policy
decision not to till up the vacancies arising prior to the
amendment of the rules. The employee does not acquire any
vested right to being considered for promotion in accordance
with the repealed rules in view of the policy decision taken by
the Government. There is no obligation for the Government to
make appointments as per the old Rules in the event of
restructuring of the cadre is intended for efficient working of
the unit. The only requirement is that the policy decisions of the
Government must be fair and reasonable and must be justified
on the touchstone of
Article 14.

82.4 The principle in
Y.V. Rangaiah v. J. Sreenivasa Rao

(1983) 3 SCC 284 need not be applied merely because posts

& 908/2022

83. The above referred observations made in the fifteen
decisions that have distinguished
Rangaiah
case demonstrate
that the wide principle enunciated therein is substantially
watered-down. Almost all the decisions that distinguished
Rangaiah hold that there is no rule of universal application to
the effect that vacancies must necessarily be filled on the basis
of law that existed on the date when they arose. This only
implies that decision in Rangaiah is confined to the facts of that
case.

84. The decision in
Deepak Agarwal Vs. State of U.P.
,
(2011) 6 SCC 725 is a complete departure from the principle
in Rangaiah inasmuch as the Court has held that a candidate
has a right to be considered in the light of the existing
rule. That is the rule in force on the date the consideration takes
place.

This enunciation is followed in many subsequent
decisions including that of
Union of India v. Krishna Kumar
,
(2019) 4 SCC 319. In fact, in Krishna Kumar Court held that
there is only a "right to be considered for promotion in
accordance with rules which prevail on the date on which
consideration for promotion takes place."

85. The consistent findings in these fifteen decisions
that
Rangaiah
's case must be seen in the context of its own
facts, coupled with the declarations therein that there is no rule
of universal application to the effect that vacancies must

decision in Rangaiah is impliedly overruled. However, as there
is no declaration of law to this effect, it continues to be cited as
a precedent and this Court has been distinguishing it on some

Page 75 of 78

76 OA No.1035/2022

& 908/2022

ground or the other, as we have indicated hereinabove. For
clarity and certainty, it is, therefore, necessary for us to hold:

85.1. The statement in
Y.V. Rangaiah v. J. Sreenivasa Rao
that,
"the vacancies which occurred prior to the amended Rules
would be governed by the old Rules and not by the amended
Rules", does not reflect the correct proposition of law
governing services under the Union and the States under Part
XIV of the Constitution . It is hereby overruled."

25. It is clear from the above judgment of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the Rule

prevalent as on the date of selection will be

applicable even if the vacancies arose before

the Rule was enacted. Admittedly, AVC was

issued on 02.06.2014 and, therefore, for the

selection after 02.06.2014, the applicants will

be governed by the above AVC.

26. We find that the similar issue came up

Ors.]. The Ahmedabad Bench vide order dated

23.08.2022 has held in paras 6 & 7 as under:-

"6. Heard the parties' counsel and gone through the records,
and papers brought before us. Undisputedly, the
communication dated 06.06.2014 (Annexure-A/1, colly)
specifies the modalities for fitting up the posts of loco
Running Staff/LP (EMU service) as per the revised AVC. It
specifies the modality for combined seniority list. This merger
has been impugned mainly on the apprehension of loss of
promotional avenue and on the ground that the two cadres
were not to be merged. However, we see that these two
cadres were ordered to be merged mainly on the plea that
elsewhere these two were the common cadre and not the
respective ones. Further, such merger was not violative of
provisions of rules/instructions.

7. At any rate, we also see that there was a provision to
file objection to the combined seniority list, should an
employee feel dissatisfied with it, which clearly affords an
opportunity to the aggrieved employees to represent against
the proposed move of combined seniority. A decision about
maintenance or curation of a cadre is the prerogative of the
employer and here, the respondents proposed to merge the
two cadres on the grounds of their administrative/operational
exigency and in our considered view, their decision per se
does not suffer from any legal infirmity. Their steps of
operationalizing the proposed merger has given opportunity
to the affected persons to represent against it. Thus, it is not a
case of not affording opportunity to represent; and the move
has not been against provision of Para 140 of IREM.
