7. Briefly stated facts as adumbrated by applicant in the instant OA are that

applicant joined as Contingency Paid Waterwoman with the respondents w.e.f.

09.03.1982 in Department of Posts at Bankipore Head Post Office.

Subsequently, vide order dated 13.06.2000 (Annexure A-2) issued by the then

Sr. Superintendent of Post Offices, Patna Division, applicant was conferred

Temporary Status w.e.f. 01.06.2000. In terms of G.I. Deptt. Of Posts letter

dated 30.11.1992, after rendering three years continuous service with

temporary status, casual labourers shall be treated at par with temporary Group-

Patna D employee of the Department of Posts w.e.f. 02.06.2003 and would thereby be
Bench

entitled to such benefits as are admissible to Group-D employees on regular

basis. Accordingly, after rendering three years of continuous service after

conferment of temporary status, applicant became eligible w.e.f. 02.06.2003

and entitled to be allowed all such benefits as are admissible to Group-D

employees on regular basis w.e.f. 02.06.2003 by reckoning qualifying services

under CCS (TS) Rules, 1965 and CCS (Pension) Rules and precedents in

similar cases.

8. Applicant was extended all the benefits incorporated in Dept. of Posts

letter dated 30.11.1992, except grant of MACP though she was entitled to be

allowed 1st MACP w.e.f. 02.06.2013 whereas other similarly situated

employees had been granted all the benefits including MACP. It is the case of

the applicant that vide letter dated 30.08.2013 (Annexure A-3 & A-4) issued by

Sr. Postmaster, Bankipore, Head Office, Patna, she was asked her willingness

for selection against MTS. She submitted her willingness on 02.09.2013 cannot

be denied by respondents. Claim of the applicant was pending without any

justification denying her the benefits after long active service by granting

4 OA No. /050/0743/2023

regularization of service. On attaining the age of superannuation, applicant

retired from service on 30.09.2021 after rendering 39 years of continuous

service in the respondent-Department.

9. Aggrieved, the applicant approached this Tribunal by way of OA

No.523/2016 praying for regularization of her service, which was decided on

07.01.2020 directing the respondents to the effect that a decision regarding

regularization should be taken and informed to the applicant by a speaking

order within three months from the date of receipt of the said order.

Respondents, instead of regularizing the services of applicant, claim of the

Patna applicant was postponed vide Memo dated 27.01.2020 (Annexure A-6) issued
Bench

by Sr. Superintendent of Post Office, Patna Division, Patna. The order dated

27.01.2020 (Annexure A-6) clearly establishes the fact that similarly placed

were regularized and for applicant case was kept pending due to non-

availability of vacancies of MTS Posts. The aforesaid order dated 27.01.2020 of

applicant's claim for regularization of services has been challenged by applicant

in this Tribunal by way of OA No.425/2020, which was withdrawn on

01.11.2023.

10. It is the case of applicant that after retirement, the respondents have

neither sanctioned any pensionary benefits including pension nor benefit of

MACP has been granted to her whereas the claim of the applicant is a covered

matter as various decisions on the same and similar issue have been passed by

this Hon'ble Tribunal and upheld by Hon'ble High Court of Patna. It is further

stated that very recently this Tribunal has decided one identical matter on

21.02.2022 in OA No.145/2019 (Annexure A-7) in the case of
Shiv Chandra

Sah versus Union of India & Ors.
upheld by Hon'ble High Court, Patna in

CWJC No.14115 of 2023 vide judgment dated 22.08.2024.

5 OA No. /050/0743/2023

11. Finding no response from the end of respondents, applicant submitted

her representation on 16.12.2021 to Chief Postmaster General, Bihar Circle,

Patna requesting for payment of pension as well as all other pensionary benefits

besides the benefits under MACP Scheme. The respondents did not reject the

claim of applicant vide order dated 27.01.2020 (Annexure A-6) but kept

pending till retirement and similarly placed persons regularized and granted

pension etc. as per Rules, 1965 and Rules, 1972 and 2021.

12. Per contra, opposing the claim of the applicant, respondents have filed

written statement and stated that applicant had worked as part time Contingency

Patna Paid casual labour at Bankipore HO from 1981. She was granted temporary
Bench

status casual labour w.e.f. 01.06.2000 vide Office Memorandum dated

13.06.2000 by the then Sr. Superintendent of Post Offices, Patna Division,

Patna. Applicant retired from temporary status casual labour w.e.f. 30.09.2021

on completion of 60 years of age. CCS(Pension) Rules, 1972 is not applicable

to officials, who retired from temporary status casual labour. Hence, no

pensionary benefits defined under CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 is payable to the

applicant. Applicant was appointed as TS Gr.D in Department of Posts. Hence,

she is not eligible for pensionary benefits on regular basis.

13. Respondents further averred in the WS that insofar as appointment as

MTS is concerned, as per gradation list she was shown at sl.no.20 out of 30 TS

officials working in Patna Division. As per seniority list of TS promotion to

regular MTS is made on availability of vacancy. In light of the order of this

Tribunal dated 07.01.2020, the case of the applicant was examined and it was

observed that the applicant was shown sl.no.20 out of 30 TS officials working

in Patna Division. In this regard, as per seniority list of TS promotion to MTS

was made on availability of vacancy from TS Casual labour to MTS. But the

6 OA No. /050/0743/2023

applicant was not promoted on the said post and she retired on 30.09.2021 as

TS Gr.D. After examining the claim of the applicant in compliance of

Tribunal's order, respondents passed a speaking and reasoned order dated

27.01.2020 and informed the applicant accordingly. Since the applicant was not

regularized, she is not entitled to pensionary benefits and benefits under MACP

Scheme.

CASE - LAW
Bench

18. Before examining the core issue framed. This Tribunal would first deal
with binding precedent some of the various judgments settled the law on the
similar facts and the issue involved not been referred to higher bench. So also
judgments dealing with pari-materia provisions related to same category of
employees as under:-

(i) The Hon'ble Supreme Court interpreting the scheme and policies as
applicable in present O.A. of Department of Post in three judge Bench
decision in case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors. versus Mahanagar
Telephone Nigam Ltd. And ors in W.P. No. 1119, 1276, 1623 and 1624
of 1986 decided on 29.11.1989 reported in 1990 Supp SCC 113 has
observed :-

"writ petitioner in W.P. No. 1624/1986 working as substitute
employees and casual labourers in the Department of Posts, Govt. of
India claimed relief to treat at par with regular employees and be paid
same emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Para 11 directed as under:-

" 11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual
labourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year
continuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days
in the case of officers observing five days week) and on
conferment of temporary status, House Rent Allowance and
City Compensatory Allowance shall be admissible. There
would be no justification to withhold Maternity Leave as that
is an obligation of the employer under the law and the state as
an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State
Policy envisaged in Part-IV of the Constitution should
provide the same. After rendering three years of continuous
service with temporary status, the casual labouers shall be
treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the
Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
benefits as are admissible to Group "D" employees on regular
basis."

(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in case of Yashwant
Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in (1996) 7 SCC 113,

14 OA No. /050/0743/2023

dealing with question for determination "whether appellant is entitled to
any pensionary benefits since total service of more than eighteen years
was in quasi-permanent/temporary." The Hon'ble Supreme Court has
held:-

"3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for
the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the
appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of
quasi-permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was
necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.
It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was
in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary
benefits.

There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant was
not made permanent even when he had served the Government for
18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is denied
the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not a
permanent employee of the government. The appellant having
served the government for almost-two decades it would be unfair to
treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.

Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we
hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent
after he served the Government for such a long period. The services
Patna
of the appellant shall be treated to be in permanent capacity and he
Bench shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits. We allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Tribunal and direct the respondents to
treat the appellant as having been retired from service on 7.3.1980
after serving the Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of
permanent service) and as such his case for grant of pension be
finalized within six months from the receipt of this order. The
appellant shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date
of retirement.

(iii) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical facts
and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain Singh,
CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017. Their Lordships was
seisin with similar issue as decided by Central Administrative Tribunal
Bench, Patna in O.A. No. 900 of 2012 vide order dated 18.2.2016 The
Union of India- Ministry of Communication, Department of Posts taken
plea as before Tribunal that services of private respondents Temporary
Status Casual Labour, was never regularized nor worked on a regular
group 'D' post till his retirement. Therefore he is not entitled to pensioner
benefits. Their Lordships in case of
Kritnarain Singh
(supra) affirmed
view taken by this Tribunal in OA No. 900/2012 based on Hon'ble High
Court Patna judgement dated 15.12.2015 in CWJC No. 17204/2015. So
also their Lordships observed that Tribunal has taken correct view
because in similar and identical circumstances the High Court held in
favour of an employee and that judgment stands and holds the field and
writ application dismissed.

(iv) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical case in
facts and legal issue in case of
Union of India versus Smt Ram Kali

11435 of 2017 decided on 11.9.2017. Their Lordships
were seisin with similar issue as involved in the present case. The Union
of India, Department of Posts had challenged order dated 22.3.2017
passed in O.A. No. 664/2015 (Patna) by this Tribunal to pay family
pension, retiral dues to widow of deceased employee.

Their Lordships observed that husband of petitioner granted
temporary status at part with Group 'D' as far as on 29/30.11.1992 and he
died in harness on 17.4.2015 i.e. after completion of more than 25 years
of service. The fact that 50% of the period even in temporary status begets
the benefits of pension. Failure on part of postal department not to
regularize services of husband of private respondents cannot be

15 OA No. /050/0743/2023

appreciated. Their Lordships decided in favour of temporary status
employee at par with Group 'D' employee and upheld order dated
22.3.2017 in similar OA No. 664/2015 (Patna). So also observed that in
similar and identical cases adjudicated in favour of employees in OA No.

dated 7.11.2007 in CWJC No. 4475/2007 and order of the High Court
Patna has been affirmed by Hon'ble Apex Court on 4.12.2009. So also

upheld directions by this Tribunal extending benefits of pension as
employee was granted temporary status at par with Group 'D' employee.

(v) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with similar legal core
issue as involved in the present case interpreted rules applicable in
the present OA in hand.
In the case of
Union of India and others
versus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar, CWJC No.
7760 of 2015
decided on 8.12.2022 reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 by their
Lordships affirming order dated 28.3.2013 passed in O.A 164/2008
(Patna). The Tribunal has granted family pension and other pensionary
benefits to widow of deceased employee died as temporary employee
without being regularized.

Their Lordships dealing with the identical issue "whether deceased
Patna employee who was appointed as a casual labourer and thereafter stepped
Bench into the status of temporary employee w.e.f. 23.10.1992 and died in
harness on 15.11.2007 and his legal heirs is entitled to benefit of
pension/family pension or not ?"

So also held that sub-clause (3) of clause (2) of Para 5 of Casual
Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization Scheme is
crystal clear that temporary employees is entitled to pension and
retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in the
temporary status followed by regularization. Their Lordships further
observed that if temporary employee died in harness his Legal heirs are
entitled to family pension in light of Rule 10(2) of Temporary Service
Rules i.e Central Civil Services (Temporary Service) Rules 1965 read
with CCS Pension Rules 1972 and temporary rules is a social legislation
beneficial legislation to a beneficiary is required to be extended with
reference to various judicial pronouncements on the principle of
beneficial legislation and affirmed order dated 20.3.2013 in OA No. 164
of 2008 (CAT, Patna) rejecting CWJC No. 7760/2015 of Department of
Posts. Their Lordships also directed as under :-

"10. Respondent is a legal heir and she is awaiting for certain monetary
benefits for more than decade, therefore, the petitioner department is hereby
directed to calculate monetary benefits in the light of sub-rule (2) of Rule 10
of Rules 1965 and same shall be extended to the respondent within a period of
three months from the date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the
rate of 8% p.a. from 1.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondent's husband

Vijay L. Mehrotra versus State of U.P., (2001) 9 SCC 687."

(vi) The Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh, Shimla in
CWP No. 2299 of 2014, The Sr. Superintendent of Posts offices versus
Shri Painu Ram decided on 23.7.2018, dealing with identical issue on
facts and legal points and law as involved in present O.A "whether a part
timer, who was conferred temporary status was entitled for same benefits,
as are admissible to reglar employees in terms of instructions dated
12.4.1991 as amended on 30.11.1992 issued by respondent department
post or not ?"

The writ petition was directed against order dated 31.1.2014
passed by learned Central Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench, in
OA No. 426/HP/2013 Painu Ram Vs Union of India & ors granting
relief in favour of original applicant therein, The Hon'ble High Court
considered Department of Post Government of India Plicy dated
30.11.1992 relied by the learned Tribunal and judgement of Hon'ble

16 OA No. /050/0743/2023

Supreme Court in
Jagritti Mazdoor Union (Regd
) (supra) and held that
after the conferment of the temporary status upon the present respondent,
he was entitled for benefits which are accrueable to a regular Group 'D'
employee after completion of three years of service on temporary basis.
So also considered judgements of various Benches of learned Tribunal
and upheld the order dated 31.1.2014 in O.A. No. 426/HP/2013
(Chandigarh).

(vii) Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh
in case of
Mrs. Alka Sharma versus Union of India
, 2017 (2) SCT 739
(P&H) (DB) dealing with the issue in the case of widow of the railway
employee in pari materia provision of family pension "whether widow of
temporary employee not been subsequently appointed on substantive post
could be granted pension and family pension under Railway Services
(Pension) Rules as for no fault of deceased employee on lapses on
railways could not be considered for regularization". The Hon'ble High
Court considered the fact that employee himself was not at fault for such
lack of regularization, never called for regularization purposes. The
Hon'ble High Court considered relevant Rules 75, governing Family
Pension Scheme for railway servants, 1964 and factum that deceased
employee was otherwise not regularized inspite of 14 years in temporary
capacity and at time of the death was still working as temporary
employee.

Patna
The Hon'ble High Court directed the respondents to grant of
Bench family pension and other retiral benefits of the deceased employee by
notionally treating his services as regularized, arrears to pension only for
a period of three years preceding the date of filing O.A.

19. In the other similar and identical situation, The Central Administrative
Tribunal also adjudicated cases and decided in favour of original applicants on
similar facts and legal issue as involved in the present OA in hand and some of
them are cited as under:-

(a)(i) The Division Bench of this Tribunal in O.A. No. 050/00143/2018

Awadhesh Prasad Singh versus The Union of India & ors
decided on
28.10.2021. The said O.A. was filed by Night Guard working in Department of
Posts seeking pension and other pensionary benefits in terms of Rule 10, CCS
(TS) Rules 1965 read with GID (3) below Rule 2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.

The learned Tribunal observed that as per judgement by The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in
Uma Devi
's case, Department of Posts has circulated policy in June/July
2014 for regularization of casual labours having worked for ten years or more and
vide judgement dated 13.11.2017 Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.
12126/2017 directed to consider in light of the policy. The applicant Awadhesh
Prasad Singh was engaged as Jeep Driver on 13.1.1984 on daily wages, conferred
temporary status w.e.f. 29.11.1989 and retired on October, 2019 after 35 years of
total service as temporary status and not been regularized.

The Division bench of this Tribunal considering impact of clause 5 of
Government of India, Department of Posts letter No. 66-9/91-SPB. I dated 30th
November, 1992- benefits to a casual labour on completion of three years service
in Temporary status become entitled to be treated at par with temporary Group
'D' employees of the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such
benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis such as
counting of service for purposes of pension and terminal benefits as in the case of
temporary employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
retirement benefits after the regularization. The learned Tribunal in Para 17 of
order relied on larger bench decision dated 2.9.2019 of Hon'ble Supreme Court in
case of
Prem Singh versus State of Uttar Pradesh and others
reported in
(2019) 10 SCC 516 reads as under :-

"35. There are some of the employees who have not been regularized in
spite of having rendered the services for 30-40 or more years whereas
they have been superannuated. As they have worked in work-charged

17 OA No. /050/0743/2023

establishment, not against any particular project, their services ought to
have been regularized under the Government instructions and even as per
the decision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma
Devi 2006 (4) SCC 1. This Court in the said decision has laid down that
in case services have been rendered for more than ten years without the
cover of the Court's order, as one time measure, the services be
regularized of such employees. In the facts of the case, those employees
who have worked for ten years or more should have been regularized. It
would not be proper to regulate them for consideration of regularisation
as others have been regularised, we direct that their services be treated as
a regular one. However, it is made clear that they shall not be entitled to
claiming any dues of difference in wages had they been continued in
service regularly before attaining the age of superannuation. They shall be
entitled to receive the pension as if they have retired from the regular
establishment and the services rendered by them right from the day they
entered the work-charged establishment shall be counted as qualifying
service for purpose of pension.

36. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the U.P. Retirement Benefits
Rules, 1961, we hold that services rendered in the work-charged
establishment shall be treated as qualifying service under the aforesaid
rule for grant of pension. The arrears of pension shall be confined to three
years only before the date of the order. Let the admissible benefits be paid
Patna
accordingly within three months. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the
Bench employees are allowed and filed by the State are dismissed."

(ii) Hon'ble High Court, Patna in CWJC No.128 of 2024 in
Union of India &
Ors. vs. Awadhesh Prasad Singh
(arising out of order dated 02.08.2021 in
OA
No.050/00143/2018 Awadhesh Prasad Singh vs. Union of India & Ors.
). Their
Lordships vide order dated 08.04.2024, heard the matter at length and observed that
no prima facie case made out. Thereafter vide order dated 20.06.2024 upheld order
dated 28.10.2021 in OA No.143 of 2018. The present OA on hand also no different.

(b) In the similar and identical situation the learned Coordinate Bench
Chandigarh of the Tribunal recently in October 2023 adjudicated in OA No.
060/690/2019 (Chandigarh) Santosh Kumar versus Union of India & ors
allowed OA directing to grant family pension and other retiral benefits of the
deceased employee. The learned Tribunal dealt issue "whether the person
who has not been regularized by the respondents the provision of Rule 54 (2)
of the CCS Pension Rules, 1972 is attracted or not ? The learned Tribunal
has considered the matter and examined in detail Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension
Rules, 1972 and observed that provisions are pari materia to Rule 75- Family
Pension Scheme for Railway servants, 1954.
So also held that case is covered
by judgement in case of
Alka Sharma vs Union of India & ors
2017 (2)
SCT (P&H) (DB) passed by Hon'ble High Court Punjab & Haryana.

So also
case of
Sr. Superintendent of Post Offices and ors vs Painu Ram
in CWP.

No.22990/2014 decided on 23.7.2018 by Hon'ble High Court of Himachal
Pradesh and reliance has also been placed upon judgement passed by Hon'ble
Supreme Court in case of
Jagrit Mazdoor Union (Regd) and others vs
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd & anr
etc, 1990 supp. SC 113.

So also
observed that case is fully covered by judgement of Hon'ble High Court of
Himachal Pradesh in matter of
Union of India vs Meena Devi
in CWP No.
34 of 2014 decided on 23.7.2018.

20. In present case this Tribunal is dealing with the issue "whether applicant
casual labour of department of posts obtaining temporary status accordance
with the scheme not regularized retired on 30.09.2021 is entitled to pension and
pensionary benefits?"

18 OA No. /050/0743/2023

21. Admittedly, applicant was initially engaged on 09.03.1982 as
Contingency Paid Casual Labourer in year 1982. The department of posts vide
instruction dated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily wagers working in post
offices are to be treated as casual labourers. The department of posts has made
Scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and
Regularization) Scheme effective from 01.10.1989. The scheme provided
provisions for conferment of temporary status to casual labourers. So also the
scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D' regular employee available
on conferment of status of temporary employee.

22. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition before
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of
Jagrit Mazdoor Union and ors versus
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.
1990 Supp. SCC 113 seeking relief that
Patna
Bench
substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts be paid same
emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that
"temporary status would be available to the casual labourers in the postal
department on completion of one year of continuous service with at least 240
days of work and on conferment of temporary status. The state as an ideal
employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy should treat similarly
with regular employees in the department".

23. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench in
Jagrit Mazdoor
Union
(supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under:-

"After rendering three years of continuous service with temporary status, the
casual labourers shall be treated at part with temporary Grade 'D' employees of
the Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are
admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis."

[Emphasis Supplied]

24.
In compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of

Jagrit Mazdoor Union
(supra). The Department of Posts, Government of
India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary
Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and scheme has been
drawn up by the Department in consultation with Ministry of Law, Finance and
Personnel and his Excellency the President of India has been graciously
pleased to approve with intention to provide benefits to casual labourers
working continuously for long period.

19 OA No. /050/0743/2023

25. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force, social and
beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend benefits
to long continuous working of casual labourers.

26. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991 confers temporary status on casual
labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant is appointee i.e.
09.03.1982 of year 1982 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize and
ought to have been superannuated before 30.09.2021 accordance with law as
regular employee for no fault of applicant made to suffer violating
Article 14
,
, 31A
and
of the Constitution of India.

27. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.06.2000
pursuant to order dated 13.06.2000 (Annexure A-2) and the statutory binding

Patna
scheme has conferred after 3 years w.e.f. 02.06.2003 certain advantages to
Bench
temporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay
scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA. Para 3
provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to a Group 'D'
employee after completion of one year of service from date of conferment of
Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant of increment to a
government servant on same scale of pay. The legislative intent is clear as
noon day in formulating the statutory scheme dated 12.4.1991 and writ in the
nature of mandamus would certainly lie to enforce the terms as social
legislation to enhance social welfare and achieve social justice. The Central
Government being an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State
Policies envisaged in the Part IV of the Constitution of India treating temporary
status casual labour after long period at par with temporary Group 'D'
employee of the Department granting benefits and treating at par with and
entitled for such benefits as are admissible to the Group 'D' employee on
regular basis. The scheme further provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity
Leave as to regular Group 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary
status for retirement benefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on
absorption. So also the scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation
with harmonious construction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically
provides for conferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three
years continuous service as temporary status.

20 OA No. /050/0743/2023

28. The applicant was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.06.2000
(Annexure A-2) and accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of
beneficial construction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant
after three years since 01.06.2000 meaning thereby since 02.06.2003 has
attained status of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to
G.P.F. The applicant was in capacity of temporary employee. The applicant
having continuously worked as temporary status casual labourer since
01.06.2000 and on 02.06.2003 is holder of post of temporary employee/quasi
permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by the model employer state
accordance with guarantee enshrined in the
Article 14
and
of the
Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof that it is unfair to
continue the applicant such a long 39 years in temporary post and without
considering for regularizing till retirement.

Patna
Bench

29. The applicant acquired status of temporary employee Group 'D' of
Department of Posts on 02.06.2003 and it is well settled in law that entitled for
such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis. So
also held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Jagrit Mazdoor Union
(supra).

30. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms no
recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers
available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not discharged
statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of the
Constitution of India and applicant was not regularized as for no fault cannot be
made to suffer. The official respondents did not discharge his duty and not
regularized on time for own mistakes respondents cannot take advantages and
plea not even considered for regularization available to them that since no
regularization no pension etc. Respondents on 30.08.2013 already taken consent
found fit for promotion to MTS.

31. The applicant submitted representation dated 16.12.2021 to allow to
participate in absorption to regularize services on regular cadre post but no
response. The respondents have stated in Para 8 of the written statement that
applicant could not be provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D'
through selection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual
labourers. Para 14 & 15 of written statement and averments of OA that
respondents not regularized services of applicant. The applicant was never at

21 OA No. /050/0743/2023

fault for such lack of regularization due to lack of vacancies. Applicant filed
OA No.143 of 2018 and vide order dated 28.10.2021 disposed of an filed
another OA No.523 of 2016 to regularize. This Tribunal vide order dated
07.01.2020 directed the respondents, thereafter vide order dated 27.01.2020
(Annexure A-6) - respondents held as per vacancy and seniority-wise, applicant
shall be considered. But in 39 years of active service respondents did not
regularize for no fault of applicant and applicant cannot be denied pension etc.
Applicant filed OA No. 425/2020 challenging order dated 27.01.2020
(Annexure A-6) and withdrawn OA No.425/2020 on 01.11.2023 as present OA
was pending already sub-judice on same legal issue.

32. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant in
the O.A that respondents have not regularized services on regular post as per
Patna
Bench
law on time, in spite of written requests and retired on 30.09.2021 without
being regularized. This Tribunal is of the view since respondents state failed to
discharge his statutory duty as per the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even
once considered for regularization since 1982. Hence respondents cannot take
advantage of own mistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not
regularized deceased employee before retirement. The matter of right, right
accrued pursuant to the scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he ought
to have at least considered for regularization before date of superannuation. The
applicant worked since 1982 till 30.09.2021 almost more than thirty nine (39)
years in the department in Contingency Paid capacity.

33. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced herein
above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also policy dated
30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I. (5). Benefits of
casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status
reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to the employee in
light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be taken away by
respondents. The Department of Posts, Ministry of Telecommunication & I.T.
Union of India formulated policy dated 12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of
implementation results in failure of social-economic justice. So also envisaged
in D.P.S.P. Part IV of Constitution. These policy, scheme circulars are
substantive attempts to enhance social welfare. The respondents denied to
employee accrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and
tortuous roads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless

22 OA No. /050/0743/2023

regularized no pensionry benefits. The said contention deserves to be rejected
and applicant can not be denied relief claimed.

34. The sub-clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated 30.11.1992
quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal
department with effect from date of completion three years of service in newly
acquired temporary status in present case w.e.f. 02.06.2003 becomes entitled to
benefits admissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of
service for purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary
employees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and
retirement benefits after their regularization.

35. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are

Patna
regulated by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The
Bench
Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death
gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions as
are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the CCS
Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim for pension
and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Rules 2
CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired without substantive
appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per Rules 1965 and Pension
Rules 2021.

36. The CCS Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as
extracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes
temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules 2021
are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant. So also the
explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6) cases
of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil services and
posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st December, 2003,
who retired or were retired before having been appointed in a substantive
capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be payable to the government
servant to the extent provided in the Central Civil Services (Temporary Service)
Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to benefits as admissible to any other
public servant and respondents have violated fundamental right enshrined in

Article 14
and
of Constitution of India.

23 OA No. /050/0743/2023

37. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three years
service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated 30.11.1992
provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and retirement
benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary status followed
by regularization.

38. The applicant stood retired on 30.09.2021 as temporary employee for no
fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge her duties and no
rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with Pension
Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension, family
pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status of employee
was at par with regular employee on long 39 years continuation on temporary
post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory Rules 1965 read with Pension
Patna
Bench
Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy decision.

39. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes it
clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a
substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type of category of
temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension, retirement gratuity,
death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant same scale as
admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to the extent
provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:-

(i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation
after having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent
service of not less than 10 years.

(ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of
continuous temporary service.

(iii) In event of death while in service.

40. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes
clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021
(erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the matter and in view of
whereof of the firm view that Government of India, Department of Posts
instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-I dated 30.11.1992
and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social legislation when read
conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965 and the Schemes beneficial
legislation makes it clear that temporary status in department of posts rendered
service not less than ten years in newly acquired temporary status becomes
entitled for regularization, pension and pensionery benefits. The failure on the

24 OA No. /050/0743/2023

part of respondents to implement Rule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension
Rules 2021 is failure of social justice and social legislation for casual labourers
the said legislation is substantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state
as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy
envisaged in Part IV of the Constitution.

41. Thus respondents cannot take advantages of their own wrong and lapses
and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant entitled to
receive pension as if retired from regular establishment and so also held by
Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgment in case of
Prem Singh versus
State of U.P & Ors
(2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced herein above.

42. The contention of the respondents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in

on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie order dated 27.3.2018 passed in
O.A. No. 372/2017 (
Bhikhani Devi Vs Union of India
) as Tribunal relied on
ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP dismissed against
same.

Their Lordships in case of
Bhikhani Devi
(supra) observed that
judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and none
of them considered the impact of Circular dated 15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that
there is no automatic appointment from temporary status to regular Group 'D'
unless absorbed as per rules. So also Tribunal not adjudicated points unless an
employee is in regular service in cadre, pensionary benefits would not be
admissible.

43. The learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the Division
Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal issue dealt in
detail rules applicable in case of
Union of India and ors versus Meena Devi

extended to the respondents within a period of three months from the
date of receipt of this order, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a.
from 01.3.2008 in the light of the fact that respondents husband died on
15.11.1997 and in the light of Apex Court's decision in the case of Vijay
L. Mehrotra v. State of U.P. (2001)9 SCC 687."

issue in hand in present case also qualified by precedents binding judicial
pronouncements cited herein above of Hon'ble Supreme Court and High Court
of Punjab & Himachal Pradesh and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna and
Coordinate Benches of this Tribunal and present case is no different. This
Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the case of applicant is a covered

integra. The applicant is also entitled for the same treatment and consequential
benefits envisaged in the Fundamental Right under
Article 14

26 OA No. /050/0743/2023

clear that temporary employee is entitled to pension and retirement benefits, if
he has completed three years of service in temporary status followed by
regularization. The applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 01.06.2000 and
not been regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood

family pension scheme for Railway Segvants 1964. It is also submitted that
Rule for family pension no where provides that the individual is to be a regular
employee. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Yashwant Hari Kakkar

benefits simply on ground that he was not a permanent employee not
regularized after served for 18 ½ years.

worked continuously more than seventeen years died in harness while working
as Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' employee status in Postal
Department, not been regularized, widow was denied family pension etc.
This
Tribunal referred ration laid down in O.A. No. 164 of 2008 (
Meena Devi vs.
Union of India
) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in CWJC No.7760 of 2015
(
Union of India versus Meena Devi
) vide judgment dated 08.12.2022,
Hon'ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled for pension, family pension.

Reference for consideration before Tribunal in case of Rita Devi (Supra) was
whether applicant - widow of Temporary Status at par with Group 'D' -
without regularization was entitled for pension, family pension and benefits this
Tribunal vide order dated 05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as
regular Group 'D' (MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at

In case of
Shiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India & Others

O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin with issue -
whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as Temporary Status
at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled for pension and other
retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for promotion to MTS, regular post
and applicant did not accept and continued as Temporary Status and retired as
temporary status employee at par with Group 'D'. Applicant started
employment as Night Guard on daily basis in Postal Department, conferred
status of Temporary Status, selected as MTS, did not join denied pension,

28 OA No. /050/0743/2023

family pension.

This Tribunal in case
Shiv Shankar Sah
(Supra) considered
orders passed in similar facts in OA No.372/2017, OA 609/2017, OA 664/2015
upheld in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 by Hon'ble High Court, Patna - failure on
part of Postal Department not to regularize the services of husband, private
respondent in 23 years of service after having granted temporary status at par
with Group 'D' employee and conduct of postal department cannot be
appreciated or ignored. So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978
of 2017 upheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing
respondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under old
pension scheme.

52. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that as per rules
for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary benefits on
Patna
Bench
regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which includes full service
after regularization and 50% service rendered under temporary status. On
working for three years as Temporary Status treated at par with Group 'D'
employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary status employee is not
regularized having served more than 20 years, it can only be due to failure of
respondents department. Temporary Status employee officials otherwise
meeting conditions for regularization and pensionary benefits were thus eligible
for pension and retirement benefits. So also this Tribunal considered order
passed in identical case OA No.143 of 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not
regularized and allowed OA for grant of pension.
In case of
Shiv Chandra Sah

(Supra) vide order dated 21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant

29 OA No. /050/0743/2023

issue any order of regularization during 27 years of applicant's service and right
accrued as per Rule 10 of CCS (Temporary Status) Rules 1965 Read with Rule
2 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972.
So also placed reliance in case OA

2017 in
Ratneshwar Singh

In
Yashwant Hari Katakkar
(supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court

not made permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½
years. It would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary
benefits simply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent
employee of the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances
appellant was deemed to have become permanent after he served the
government for such a long period. The services shall be treated to be
permanent capacity and shall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.

Bench 45. In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5
of the Scheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to
benefit to casual labourers on completion of three years service in
temporary status of Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and
regularization) Scheme is crystal clear that temporary employee is entitled
to pension and retirement benefits, if he has completed three years of
service in temporary status followed by regularization, The husband of
applicant granted temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been
regularized by respondents inspite of requests and for no fault stood

(Erstwhile Rule 54 (2) of CCS Pension Rules 1972) and pari materia
provision in Rule 75 of family pension scheme for Railway Segvants
1964. It is also submitted that Rule for family pension no where provides
that the individual is to be a regular employee. The Hon'ble Supreme
Court in case of
Yashwant Hari Kakkar
(supra) has held that it would
be travesty of justice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on

60. Respondents much emphasized that applicant while working as
Temporary Status - Water Woman expressed her willingness to be promoted as
regular employee, but not appointed on regular Group 'D' employee. As
evident from pleadings applicant worked since year 1982 as Contingency Paid
Water Woman but in more than 39 years of service could not be regularized and
applicant never refused to be regularized on post she was working. Respondents
have not produced any order that applicant was promoted and this Tribunal
finds that argument has no force and devoid of merit and repelled.

Union of India versus
Ratneshwar Singh, CWJC No.13117
of 2019 vide judgment dated 03.07.2019
