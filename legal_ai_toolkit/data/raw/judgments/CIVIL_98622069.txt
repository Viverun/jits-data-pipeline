3. The plaint averments in brief are as under:

The 1st plaintiff is the wife, 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs

are the daughters of late Dodda Abbaiah. The said

Dodda Abbaiah and the defendant No.1 are the direct

7 OS No.5985/1988

brothers and sons of late Sidda Reddy. The plaintiffs

and the defendants are governed by Hindu Undivided

Joint Family and suit schedule properties are all

ancestral and joint family properties. The said Dodda

Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 at Bellandur Village leaving

behind the plaintiffs and his rights and interest in the

suit schedule properties. The plaintiffs are the sole

surviving successors to the estate of Late Dodda

Abbaiah.

The said Dodda Abbaiah and the defendant were

acquired and managing the suit schedule ancestral

undivided joint family properties. After the death of

said Dodda Abbaiah, the defendant alone is managing

the suit schedule properties. During the life time of Late

Dodda Abbaiah, he was very much concerned and

interested to effect the partition and division of the joint

family suit schedule properties between himself and the

defendant. The said Dodda Abbaiah died unexpectedly

8 OS No.5985/1988

to the surprise of the plaintiffs and relations without

effecting the partition.

After the death of Dodda Abbaiah the plaintiffs

requested and advised the defendant to have a

settlement and divide the suit schedule properties by

metes and bounds. The defendant refused to effect

partition, but started to enjoy independently as his

own.

The plaintiffs are also succeeded to the estate of

deceased Dodda Abbaiah, who is entitled to half share

in all the ancestral joint family properties, which were

owned and possessed jointly along with the defendant.

The plaintiffs are entitled to equal shares in the half

share in the joint family suit schedule properties.

The defendant is now proclaiming that he alone is

entitled to the suit schedule property and making

arrangements to alienate the suit schedule properties

without any notice to the plaintiffs and also making

attempts to change the revenue records and documents

9 OS No.5985/1988

in his individual names. The defendant refused partition

of the suit schedule properties. The defendant is

depriving the rights of the plaintiffs over the suit

schedule properties.

The plaintiffs are also issued legal notice dated

13.1.1988 calling upon the defendant to effect partition

in the suit schedule properties by metes and bounds.

The defendant instead of effecting partition, issued an

untenable reply dated 27.1.1988 and thus refused to

effect partition.

The plaintiffs are legally entitled for half share in

all the suit schedule properties as the plaintiffs are the

surviving successors to the estate of Late Dodda

Abbaiah, who died in the year 1987 leaving behind the

plaintiffs and his half share of estate in the undivided

joint family ancestral suit schedule properties.

During the pendency of the suit, the defendants

No.1 and 2 have formed sites in the following item Nos.3

10 OS No.5985/1988

defendants No.3 to 6 as detailed hereunder.

measuring 1 acre 0.03 guntas

2) The portion of item No.5 bearing Sy.No.79/3

matter of LAC.No.57/2008 and the same is pending

suit.

4. Upon service of summons, the defendant No.1

appeared before the court through his counsel and filed

written statement contending that Late Dodda Abbaiah was

the elder brother of this defendant and 1st plaintiff married

Dodda Abbaiah about 50 years ago, but she did not live with

him for a couple of years as his wife. She deserted and

walked out of the life of Dodda Abbaiah more than 45 years

ago and was openly living with one Kadubisanahally

Narayana Reddy for a few years as his mistress. After some

years she left him and was living at different places and

presently she is living at the address given in the plaint. After

the 1st plaintiff deserted him, Dodda Abbaiah married again

one Chinnamma, who was living with him till she died about

13 OS No.5985/1988

30 years ago. The Late Dodda Abbaiah did not have any

issue either from the 1st plaintiff or his 2nd wife.

In as much as they were never born while the 1st

plaintiff was living with Late Dodda Abbaiah in his house or

while she was living with Kadubisanahally Narayana Reddy.

Till today this defendant does not know hen and where the

2nd and 3rd plaintiffs were born to the 1st plaintiff. He admits

that Dodda Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 at Bellandur Village.

This defendant and his brother Dodda Abbaiah were never

living as members of joint Hindu family and there were no

joint family properties to be shared between them at the time

of death of Dodda Abbaiah as alleged. The suit schedule

properties are in exclusive possession and enjoyment of the

defendant are his own absolute properties, in which late

Dodda Abbaiah had no right, title or interest.

Late Dodda Abbaiah after the death of his 2nd wife

relinquished his share in the ancestral properties i.e. item

No.2 and 4 to 7 of the suit schedule properties in favour of

this defendant and left village and living in different places for

14 OS No.5985/1988

a few years. He returned to the village after 20 years ago and

living a life of mendicant and eking out his livelihood by

engaging himself as an agricultural labourer and after

completing 60 years of age he was getting old age pension for

the last 15 years till his death and was maintaining himself

with that pension amount and small helps given by well-

wishers and sympathizers in the village.

a) The suit schedule item No.1 and 3 are the self acquired

properties of defendant. He purchased the 1st item as

vacant site from his own funds and built the present house

thereon from his own funds. Likewise the item No.3 was

purchased by defendant under sale deed dated 20.8.1964

from one Venkatappa @ Abbaiah Reddy from his own

funds. The khatha of all the properties are changed to the

name of this defendant and he is in possession and

enjoyment of the same as sole absolute owner thereof.

15 OS No.5985/1988

As a matter of fact Late Dodda Abbaiah had given his

consent and no objection for the transfer of khatha in favour

of this defendant in respect of ancestral family properties,

which clearly establish that he had relinquished right if any

he had in the said properties in favour of this defendant.

That being so the plaintiffs have no legal right to claim

any share in the sole and absolute properties of the

defendant. The 1st plaintiff, who deserted Late Dodda

Abbaiah more than 45 years ago and was leading a

questionable life all these years has no legal right or

competence to claim any share n the alleged estate of Late

Dodda Abbaiah as his legal heir. The 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs are

not the daughters of Late Dodda Abbaiah and therefore they

cannot claim themselves to be the legal heirs of Dodda

Abbaiah much less claim any share in the suit schedule

properties.

Kate Dodda Abbaiah never demanded for partition and

division of the suit schedule properties at any time claiming

them to be the joint family properties of himself and the

16 OS No.5985/1988

defendant. No did the plaintiffs demand the defendant after

the death of Dodda Abbaiah to effect division of the suit

schedule properties by metes and bounds. The suit schedule

properties are not the joint family properties of Dodda

Abbaiah and the defendant.

The defendant got the revenue records and documents

relating to some of the suit schedule properties changed to

his name and is also attempting to change the records and

documents relating to other suit properties to his individual

name. The defendant being the absolute and sole owner of

the suit schedule properties is entitled to exercise his right of

ownership over them in any manner and take steps to

safeguard his title and interest in his properties in the

manner he thinks best and proper. The plaintiffs have locus-

standi or authority to question the said right of exercise of

ownership by the defendant and make a grievance of it.

It is true that plaintiffs had caused legal notice dated

13.1.1988 issued to the defendant making false and

untenable allegations and the same has been suitably replied.

17 OS No.5985/1988

The 1st plaintiff deserted and walked out of the life of Dodda

Abbaiah more than 45 years.

The plaintiffs are not entitled to maintain the suit for

partition as they are not at all the legal heirs of deceased

Dodda Abbaiah and even otherwise Late Dodda Abbaiah

having relinquished his share in the ancestral properties in

favour of defendant more than 30 years ago, from which

period the defendant is in exclusive possession of all the

properties in his own right, exercising right of ownership

openly and uninterruptedly all these years. Items No.1 and 3

are the self acquired properties of defendants and as such the

plaintiffs have no right to claim any share in the said items.

Item No.6 has been sold by the defendant to one

B.Venkataswamy Reddy, son of Pillaiah under registered sale

deed dated 17.9.1984 and said purchaser is in possession of

the said land. The suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary

parties i.e. alinee of item No.6 of the schedule property has

not been made as a party to the suit. Hence, prayed to

dismiss the suit.

18 OS No.5985/1988

5. The defendant No.1 died during the pendency of

the suit and thereafter his legal heirs were brought on record

as defendant No.1(a) and 1(b). The defendant No.1(a) and (b)

are also died, and their legal heirs i.e. the defendant No.1(a)(i)

and 1(b)(i) were brought on record, who appeared before the

court through their counsel and filed additional written

statement contending that Chikka Abbaiah had married

Smt.Thimmakka and Smt.Papamma, they were arrayed as

defendant No.1(a) and 1(b). The defendant No.1(a) and 1(b)

during their life time have executed a Will dated 23.12.2009

bequeathing the items No.1 to 3 and 7. The defendant No.1(b)

died on 25.11.2011 and defendant No.1(a) died on 6.10.2013

leaving behind this defendant to succeed to their estate in

terms of Will dated 23.12.2009. In pursuance of the said will

the defendant No.1(a) and (b) have succeeded to the

properties under the will and in possession and enjoyment of

the same and exercising acts of ownership over the said

properties. The plaintiffs were never in possession of any

portion of suit schedule properties at any point of time and as

19 OS No.5985/1988

such the alleged joint possession is specifically denied as

false. Hence, prayed to dismiss the suit.

6. The 2nd defendant filed written statement

contending that he is bonafide purchaser of item No.3 of the

suit schedule property under two registered sale deed dated

12.2.1996 and 31.1.1996 for valuable sale consideration. At

the time of purchase, it was represented to him by the 1st

defendant that the property in question is an ancestral

property and brother of Dodda Abbaiah died issueless and

that 1st defendant was the sole surviving male successor to

the property in question. This defendant after verification of

certain facts purchased item No.3 of the suit schedule

property. The present suit is filed for partition of certain

properties against his vendor. He is not aware of any legal

proceedings pending in respect of the properties that he

purchased. Hence, he adopts the written statement filed by

1st defendant. Accordingly, prayed to dismiss the suit.

20 OS No.5985/1988

7. The defendant No.3 appeared through his counsel

but did not file his written statement.

8. Inspite of service of summons, the defendant No.4

not appeared before the court and hence he is placed exparte.

9. The defendant No.5 appeared through his counsel

but did not file his written statement.

10. The 6th defendant filed written statement

contending that during the pendency of the suit he came to

know that 1st plaintiff died leaving behind plaintiffs No.2 and

3 as her sole surviving heirs. The plaintiffs No.2 and 3 have

executed two release deeds with respect to the item No.1 and

2 of the written statement schedule properties in favour of

himself and 5th defendant. By virtue of the said release deeds

the dispute between the plaintiff on one hand and 5th

defendant and himself on the other hand stands totally

settled and adjusted in respect of item Nos.1 and 2 of the

21 OS No.5985/1988

written statement schedule properties. In that view of the

matter there is no lis between the plaintiffs No.1 and 2 on one

hand and 5th defendant and this defendant on the other hand

and the said settlement has to be recorded by this court. The

defendants No.5 and 6 are bonafide purchasers for valuable

consideration. The defendants No.5 and 6 are entitled to deal

with the properties purchased by them as they choose. There

cannot be any order restraining them from putting up

construction. He admits that Dodda Abbaiah and Chikka

Abbaiah are sons of Late Sidda Reddy. It is not known and

hence not admitted that plaintiffs and defendants are

governed by Hindu Undivided Joint family and suit schedule

properties are all ancestral and joint family properties. It is

true that Dodda Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 leaving behind

the plaintiffs as his sole surviving legal heirs. It is denied that

Dodda Abbaiah and defendants were managing the schedule

property and after the death of Dodda Abbaiah, defendant

alone is managing the schedule properties. The plaintiffs are

22 OS No.5985/1988

not entitled to equal share in the half share in the joint family

properties.

The properties were sold for legal necessities and hence

even if the plaint averments are proved the sale deed in

favour of this defendant is valid. The defendant No.5 got he

property described in item No.1 of the written statement

schedule under sale deed dated 05.07.2006 executed by

Sri.B.N.Chandrashekar and Jayarama Reddy. The vendor of

defendant No.5 purchased the said property from G.Rajashree

under sale deed dated 12.11.2003 and Smt.G.Rajashree got

the same under sale deed dated 18.02.1998 executed by

Chikka Abbaiah. The defendant No.5 is the absolute owner of

the property. However to avoid litigations and to have peace

of mind this defendant got a release deed executed by

plaintiffs No.2 and 3 and as such the suit is liable to

dismissed against the defendant No.5.

Defendant No.6 got the property described in item No.2

of the written statement schedule under sale deed dated

5.7.2006 executed by Smt.Y.Sumalatha. Said Y.Sumalatha

23 OS No.5985/1988

purchased the said property from Chikka Abbaiah vide sale

deed dated 20.01.1998. The defendant No.6 is the absolute

owner of the said property. However to avoid litigations and

to have peace of mind this defendant got a release deed

executed by plaintiffs No.2 and 3 and as such the suit is

liable to dismissed against the defendant No.5. Hence,

prayed to dismiss the suit against defendants No.5 and 6 with

respect to written statement schedule item No.1 and 2

properties, which is portion of item No.5 of the suit schedule

property.

statement contending that these defendants are not aware of

compensable payable has to be shared between plaintiff and

defendants. The defendants have purchased portion of item

No.5 of the suit schedule property. Item No.5 of the suit

schedule property has not been acquired. They denied that

during the pendency of the suit, sites are formed. Hence,

prayed to dismiss the suit.

Issue Nos.4, 10 to : In the affirmative
Issue No.12 : As per the final order,
for the following:

REASONS

17. ISSUE No.1 TO 3 AND 5 TO 7:- Since these

Issues are interconnected hence they are taken up together

common discussion in order to avoid repetition of facts and

evidence.

18. It is admitted fact that Dodda Abbaiah and

defendant No.1 are the direct brothers and sons of Late Sidda

Reddy. It is admitted fact that the 1st plaintiff is the wife of

Dodda Abbaiah. There is no dispute that the said Dodda

30 OS No.5985/1988

Abbaiah and the defendant No.1 are residents of Bellandur

Village. There is no dispute that item No.2 and 4 to 7 are the

ancestral properties of the said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant

No.1. There is no dispute that during the pendency of the suit

the defendants No.1 and 2 have formed sites in item Nos.3

and 5 of the suit schedule property and have sold the same to

defendants No.3 to 6 and the portion of the item Nos.2, 4, 6

and 7 were acquired by the Karnataka Industrial Area

Development Board, Bangalore.

19. It is further case of the plaintiffs that 2nd and 3rd

plaintiffs are the daughters of the plaintiff No.1 and Late

Dodda Abbaiah. They are the members of Hindu Undivided

Joint Family and suit schedule properties are the ancestral

and joint family properties. The said Dodda Abbaiah died on

28.6.1987 leaving behind the plaintiffs as his survival

successors. After the death of the said Dodda Abbaiah the

defendant No.1 alone managing the suit schedule properties.

During the life time of Dodda Abbaiah there was no partition

31 OS No.5985/1988

in the joint family. After the death of Dodda Abbaiah the

plaintiffs requested the defendant No.1 to divide the suit

schedule properties by metes and bounds but the defendant

No.1 refused to effect partition, but started to enjoy

independently as of his own and they are entitle for equal

share in the half share of the joint family suit schedule

properties.

20. It is the case of the defendant No.1 that the

plaintiff No.1 married Dodda Abbaiah about 50 years ago, but

she did not live with him for more than a couple of years and

she deserted and walked out of the life of Dodda Abbaiah

more than 45 years ago and openly living with one

Kadubisanahalli Narayana Reddy for few years as his

mistress and after some time she left him and was living in

different places and presently she is living in the address

shown in the cause title. After the 1st plaintiff deserted him,

Dodda Abbaiah married one Chinnamma, who was living with

him till she died about 30 years ago. The Late Dodda

32 OS No.5985/1988

Abbaiah did not have any issues either from the 1st plaintiff or

his 2nd wife. The plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the daughters

of Dodda Abbaiah and they were never born while the 1st

plaintiff was living with the Dodda Abbaiah. Dodda Abbaiah

and the defendant No.1 never living as members of the joint

family and there were no joint family properties to be shared.

The suit schedule properties are in exclusive possession and

enjoyment of the defendant No.1 as his own absolute

properties, in which Dodda Abbaiah had no right or interest.

After the death of Dodda Abbaiah his 2nd wife relinquished his

share in the item No.2 and 4 to 7 of the schedule properties

in favour of the defendant No.1 and left village and living in

different places for few years and he returned to the village

after 20 years ago. The suit schedule item Nos.1 to 3 are the

self acquired properties of defendant No.1 as he purchased

the item No.1 from his own funds and built the house therein

out of his own funds and defendant No.1 purchased the item

No.3 out of his own funds. The said Dodda Abbaiah had

given consent and no objection for the transfer of properties

33 OS No.5985/1988

in favour of the defendant No.1. The plaintiffs have no legal

right to claim any share in the suit schedule properties.

21. It is pertinent to note that in this suit one

Munireddy S/o Dodda Abbaiah Reddy as power of attorney

holder of the plaintiffs filed his affidavit in lieu of

examination-in-chief of PW1 wherein he has reiterated the

averments made in the plaint and got marked Ex.P.1 to P.73.

The plaintiffs have not produced the power of attorney

executed by them in favour of the said Munireddy S/o Dodda

Abbaiah Reddy. Hence, the oral evidence of the PW1 and

Ex.P.1 to P.73 and also the oral evidence of PW 2 & 3 cannot

be taken into consideration. So, it has to be held that there

is no oral evidence and documents exhibited on behalf of the

plaintiffs. During the pendency of the suit, the defendant

No.1 is dead and his legal representatives were brought on

record and the power of attorney holder of them is examined

as DW1 and got marked Ex.D.1 to D.3. The General Power of

Attorney holder of defendant No.2 examined as DW2 and got

34 OS No.5985/1988

marked Ex.D.4 to D.12. The defendant No.6 examined himself

as DW3 and got marked documents at Ex.D.15 to D.24.

Since this is a suit for partition hence every plaintiff is a

defendant and every defendant is a plaintiff and in the

circumstances of the case suit has to be decided by

considering the plaint and evidence led by the defendants

and documents exhibited by them on their behalf.

22. As stated above, it is the case of the defendant

No.1 that the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah

about 45 years back and openly living with one

Kadubisanahalli Narayana Reddy for few years as his

mistress and after some time she left him. As stated above the

said Dodda Abbaiah and the Defendant no. 1 are permanent

residents of Belladuru Village. The defendant No.1 has not

placed any independent evidence on record from Bellandur

Village or Kadubisanahalli village except the say of the DW1

that the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah and

openly living with one Narayana Reddy of Kadubisanahalli.

35 OS No.5985/1988

23. The DW1 during the course of cross-examination

deposed as under:

"It is not correct to suggest that Dodda
Abbaiah and Chikka Abbaiah used to
harass 1st plaintiff and on account of it quite
often she used to go to her parents house at
Govindachetty Palya and also that on those
occasions Dodda Abbaiah used to go to
Govindachetty Palya to console his wife.
This state of things continued to be there till
the demise of Dodda Abbaiah."

24. So, from the above answer of DW1 during the

course of cross-examination taken together it can be said that

the plaintiff No.1 used to go to his parents house, which is in

Govindachetty Palya for some reason or the other and the

said Dodda Abbaiah used to go to Govindachetty Palya to

console her and thereby there was access in between the

Dodda Abbaiah and plaintiff No.1 and the same state of

things continued till the death of Dodda Abbaiah. Hence, it

cannot be said that the 1st plaintiff deserted her husband and

36 OS No.5985/1988

walked out of his life more than 45 years ago. If it is taken for

the arguments sake that the plaintiff No.1 deserted the said

Dodda Abbaiah she will not loose or right to succeed to the

estate of the said Dodda Abbaiah and hence it cannot said

that she is not entitled for share in the suit schedule

property.

25. The
section 112
of Indian Evidence Act reads thus:

Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of
legitimacy- The fact that any person was
born during the continuance of valid
marriage between his mother and any
man, or within two hundred and eighty
days after is dissolution, the mother
remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive
proof that he is the legitimate son of that
man, unless it can be shown that the
parties to the marriage had no access to
each other at any time when he could have
been begotten.

37 OS No.5985/1988

So, as per
section 112
of Indian Evidence Act it has to be

presumed that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 born to the plaintiff

No.1 & the said Dodda Abbaiah during the continuance of

their valid marriage.

26. The defendant No.1 made half hearted attempt

disputing that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the daughters

of plaintiff No.1 and Dodda Abbaiah by denying and at the

same time stating in the written statement as under:-

"The Late Dodda Abbaiah did not have any
issue either from first plaintiff or his second
wife. That being the real position the
allegation that the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs are
the daughters of Late Dodda Abbaiah is
hereby emphatically denied. ..................
Till today this defendant does not know when
and where the second and third plaintiffs
were born to the first plaintiff."

So, the above averments are taken together it is clear that

the defendant No.1 do not dispute that the plaintiffs No.2 & 3

were born to the plaintiff No.1. Further, it is not the case of

38 OS No.5985/1988

the defendant No.1 that there was divorce in between plaintiff

No.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah. So, there was divorce in

between the plaintiff No.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah. As

per
section 112
of Indian Evidence Act the birth of any person

during the continuance of valid marriage it is to be

presumed that the persons born during that period are the

legitimate children.

27. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff

relied on the ruling reported in (2009) 12 Supreme Court

Cases 454 (Sham Lal @ Kuldip V/s Sanjeev Kumar and

others), wherein their lordship held as under:

"
Evidence Act, 1872
- Schedule .112 and 4 -
Legitimacy of child - Conclusive proof -
Parents of child having access to each other

- Allegation of adultery against wife - Effect

- Once the validity of marriage is proved and
parents have access to each other, adultery
of wife which though amounts to very strong
evidence, is, by itself held, not quite
sufficient to repel the presumption of

39 OS No.5985/1988

legitimacy of children born from such
wedlock - It is undesirable to enquire into
paternity of a child in such cases.
Once the validity of marriage is proved
then there is strong presumption about the
legitimacy of children born from that
wedlock. The presumption can only be
rebutted by a strong, clear, satisfying and
conclusive evidence. The circumstance
creating doubt. Even the evidence of
adultery by wife which though amounts to
very strong evidence, it by, itself, is not quite
sufficient to repel this presumption and will
not justify finding of illegitimacy if husband
has had access. In the instant case,
admittedly the plaintiff and defendant No.4
were born to D during the continuance of her
valid marriage with B. Their marriage was
in fact never dissolved. There is no evidence
on record that B at any point of time did not
have access to D."

28. The Learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff

further relied on the ruling reported in AIR 1969 Bombay

40 OS No.5985/1988

205 (V 56 C 34) Rama Ananda Patil V/s Appa Bhima Redekar

and others), wherein their lordships held as under:

"D)
Hindu Succession Act
(1956),
Section
15(2)(b)
and S.
3(1)(j)
, Proviso - 'Son or
daughter in
S.15(2)(b)
- Means son or
daughter of female dying intestate
irrespective of whether they were born to her
from one or other husband - Related -

Definition includes even illegitimate children.

The words 'son or daughter' of the
deceased in
S.15(2)(b)
of the Act can only
mean a son or daughter of the female dying
intestate without regard as to from which
husband they were born to her. This
interpretation is reinforced by the definition
of the word 'related' in Schedule.3(1(j) of the
Act. Under the proviso to this definition even
illegitimate children are to be deemed to be
'related' to their mother and to one another
for the purposes of the Act. Effect of this
definition is that the phraseology 'son or
daughter of the deceased' is to be construed
to mean not only the sons and daughters of
the female Hindu from any of her husbands,

41 OS No.5985/1988

but even son or daughters born to her in an
illegitimate manner. If, therefore, by virtue
of this definition, illegitimate son or
illegitimate daughter is to be included in the
phraseology of 'son or daughter of the
deceased' in
Section 15(2)(b)
there is no
warrant to assume that the Legislature
intended to exclude the son or daughter of
the deceased female Hindu, from inheritance
born to her from any other husband than the
husband from whom the female Hindu had
inherited the property."

29. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff

further relied on ruling reported in 1971 Punjab and Haryana

240 (Gurbachan Singh V/s Khichar Singh and another),

wherein their lordship held as under:-

"5. Mr. C. L. Aggarwal, learned counsel for
the appellants, concedes that Smt. Sant
Kaur, whatever might have been her
limitations earlier with regard to her titled to
the property, became full owner on the
coming into force of the Act, and succession

42 OS No.5985/1988

to her estate is regulated by clause firstly of

S. 15(1)(a)
which is in the following terms:-

"15. (1) The property of a female Hindu
dying intestate shall devolve according to
the rules set out in
S. 16
.

(a) firstly, upon the sons and daughters
(including the children of any pre-deceased
son or daughter) and the husband."

The only argument raised by the learned
counsel is the plaintiff could not be treated to
be the son of Smt. Sant Kaur as the latter
inherited property from her husband Mehar
Singh and the plaintiff was not born from his
loins. According to the learned counsel the
plaintiff would be deemed to be a step-son of
Smt. Sant Kaur qua the property of Mehar
Singh her first husband.
In order to support
his submission, he has invited my attention
to a Division Bench judgment of the Mysore
High Court reported as
Mallappa Fakirappa
v. Shivappa
. AIR 1962 Mys 140, where it is
held that the expression "son" in Section

43 OS No.5985/1988

15(1)(a) cannot be construed so as to include
a step-son of the deceased.

I am afraid the argument of the learned
counsel is without any substance. There can
be no manner of doubt that the plaintiff born
out of the body of Smt. Sant Kaur is her son
whatever his status qua Mehar Singh
deceased might be though such status is
wholly irrelevant. It is not the estate of
Mehar Singh that is involved but that of Smt.
Sant Kaur who was an absolute owner of
the suit property at the time of her death.
The plaintiff is here son and it is immaterial
from whose loins he might have been born. It
is again fallacious to say that the plaintiff
could be described as the step-son of Smt.
Smt Kaur or her Pichhlag.

In
Mallappa
's case, AIR 1962 Mys 140
(supra), the contest was between two sons
from different wives of one Fakirappa and in
that case one could be said to be the step-
son of another. That case is therefore, of no
assistance. The expression "son" as used in

44 OS No.5985/1988

Section 15(1)(a)
included both natural and
adopted sons. If a female remarries after the
death of her first husband or after divorce,
her son from the other husband would be
her natural son. A son may even be
illegitimate when the female from whose
body he is born is not the lawfully wedded
wife of the person from whose loins such a
sons is born but he will still be natural son of
his mother when the question of succession
on her dying intestate arises. In the matter
of succession as regulated by clause firstly
of
Section 15(1)(a)
, the expression "son" thus
includes the child born from body of the
deceased no matter what be the legal
relationship between her and the person
from whose loins he is born."

30. The learned Advocate appearing for the plaintiff

further relied on ruling reported in AIR 1975 MADRAS 275

(Narayani Ammal and another V/s Govindaswami Naidu),

wherein their lordships held as under:

45 OS No.5985/1988

"(A) Hindu Law - Succession - Stridhana -

Term "daughter" includes an illegitimate
daughter - Legitimate son cannot exclude
an illegitimate daughter. AIR 1915 Mad 63,
Overruled -
(Hindu Succession Act
(1956),

S.3 (j)
).

The textual Hindu Law as well as decided
cases have clearly laid down that
succession to stridhana property is quite
different and distinct from succession to
the property of a male Hindu and the
difference in the lines of succession is
based on different theories or concepts.
Succession to stridhana property is based
on the blood relationship of the mother to
her stridhana heirs. There is no legitimate
reason why the term 'daughter' should be
confined only to a legitimate daughter.

Thus an illegitimate child must be
recognized as an heir and the stridhana line
of succession cannot be entirely departed
from with a view to favour the son
exclusively. It is only when the stridhana
line of succession is unavailable that it is

46 OS No.5985/1988

permissible to the other line of succession.
AIR 1915 Mad 63, Overruled".

So, relying on the principles held in the above citations relied

by the plaintiff's counsel when the marriage of plaintiff No.1

and Dodda Abbaiah is admitted and there was access in

between them and the same was continued till the death of

Dodda Abbaiah and absolutely there is no evidence to show

that the plaintiff No.1 was living with Narayana Reddy of

Kadubisanahalli Village and there is no divorce in between

the plaintiff No.1 and Dodda Abbaiah and the defendant No.1

not at all disputed that the plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are not the

children of plaintiff No.1 and hence it has to be held that the

plaintiffs No.2 and 3 are the legitimate children of plaintiff

No.1 and Dodda Abbaiah and they are entitle to succeed to

the estate of the said Dodda Abbaiah.

31. As stated above, with respect to the suit schedule

properties are concerned at the first instance the defendant

No.1 contended that the suit schedule properties are absolute

47 OS No.5985/1988

properties of him and in which the said Dodda Abbaiah had

no right, title or interest. The defendant No.1 has not

explained how he became the absolute owner of the suit

schedule properties. It is came in the cross-examination of

DW1 that the said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1 were

not having any other properties other than the properties

mentioned in the plaint and out of the said income house

was improved and defendant No.1 had not given any separate

share to the said Dodda Abbaiah. This clearly goes to show

that all the items of the suit schedule properties are the joint

family properties of said Dodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1,

some are ancestral properties and some are acquired from the

income of the ancestral property. Hence, it cannot be said

that the defendant No.1 is the absolute owner of the suit

schedule properties.

32. As stated above, with respect to the item Nos.2

and 4 to 7 of the suit schedule property are concerned the

defendant No.1 contended that the item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 are

48 OS No.5985/1988

the ancestral properties and the said Dodda Abbaiah after the

death of his 2nd wife he has relinquished his share in item

Nos.2, 4 to 7 of the suit schedule property in favour of him

and left the village. A right in the immovable properties can

be released/relinquished under the registered document.

Hence the relinquishment of the right by the said Dodda

Abbaiah must be through the registered document. The

defendant No.1 has not produced any such document to the

court. Hence, it cannot be said that the said Dodda Abbaiah

relinquished his share in item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 of the suit

schedule properties about 30 years ago.

33. As stated above, with respect to the item Nos.1 &

3 concerned the defendant No.1 contended that the item

Nos.1 and 3 are the self acquired properties of him. In this

regard the Learned Advocate for the Defendant No.1 relied

ruling reported in AIR 2003 SUPREME COURT 3800

(D.S.Lakshmaiah and another V/s L.Balasubramanyam and

another), wherein their lordship held as under:

49 OS No.5985/1988

"There is no presumption of a property being
joint family property only on account of
existence of a joint Hindu family. The one
who asserts has to prove that the property is
a joint family property. If, however, the
person so asserting proves that there was
nucleus with which the joint family property
could be acquired, there would be
presumption of the property, being joint and
the onus would shift on the person who
claims it to be self acquired property to prove
that he purchased the property with his own
funds and not out of joint family nucleus that
was available.".

So, as held in the said ruling since the defendant No.1

admits that the item Nos.2 and 4 to 7 are the ancestral and

joint family properties of him and Dodda Abbaiah, then there

is no burden on the plaintiffs to prove that they are the joint

family properties and on the other hand the burden is on the

defendant No.1 to prove that item Nos.1 & 3 are the self

acquired properties of him. Except contending that out of his

own funds purchased item No.1 and also constructed house

50 OS No.5985/1988

in it and purchased the item No.3 out of his own funds, he

has not explained out of the income of which property he has

purchased the item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule

properties. The DW1 during the course of cross-examination

admitted that the income of item Nos.2, 4 to 7 was used to

purchase item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule properties

and out of the said income the house was improved. Hence,

it cannot be said that the item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit

schedule properties are the self acquired properties of

defendant No.1.

34. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff relied on

the ruling reported in 2015(3) Kar.L.J. 357(Smt. Nanjamma

V/s Smt. Akkayamma( since dead) by her LRs and others is

as follows:-

"In the case of a property belonging to co-
parcenary, joint family of or co-ownership,
possession of one co-parcener or a member
of the joint family or a co-owner is the
possession of all. To hold that the plaintiff is

51 OS No.5985/1988

in joint possession of the whole or part of the
property, which is the subject matter of the
suit. Even the plaintiff need not be getting a
share in the income from the property. So
long as the plaintiff has a right to share, the
law presumes that he is in joint possession"

So, as held in the above ruling both Dodda Abbaiah and

defendant No.1 were the co-parceners and the said Dodda

Abbaiah died on 28.6.1987 and the plaintiff No.1 being the

wife and plaintiffs No.2 and 3 being the children of Dodda

Abbaiah and hence it must be deemed to be in joint

possession of the suit schedule properties by the plaintiffs

and defendant No.1.

35. The Learned Advocate appearing for the

defendant No.1 relied on the ruling reported in AIR 1999

SUPREME COURT 1441 (Vidhyadhar V/s Mankikrao and

another), wherein their lordship held as under:

"
A) Evidence Act
:
S.114
- Adverse inference

- Party to suit - Not entering the witness box

52 OS No.5985/1988

- Give rise to inference adverse against him.

Where a party to the suit does not appear
into the witness box and states his own case
on oath and does not offer himself to be
cross examined by the other side, a
presumption would arise that the case set
up by him is not correct. In the instant case
defendant No.1 alleged that the sale deed
executed by defendant No.2 in favour of the
plaintiff was fictitious and the whole
transaction was a bogus transactions as
only Rs.500/- were paid as sale
consideration to defendant No.2. But this
plea was not supported by defendant No.1
as he did not enter into the witness box. He
did not state the facts pleaded in the written
statement on oath in the trial court and
avoided the witness box so that he may not
be cross-examined. This, by itself, is enough
to reject the claim that the transaction of sale
between defendant No.2 and the plaintiff
was a bogus transaction."

53 OS No.5985/1988

36. The Learned Advocate appearing for the defendant

No. 1 relied on the ruling reported in 2005(2) KCCR 831

(Janakibai and another V/s Shyamasundar Rander), wherein

their lordship held as under:

"EVIDENCE ACT, 1872 -
Section 101
-
Burden of proof - Unless the plaintiff lays
some semblance of evidence, it is not
necessary for defendant to rebut. When
both the parties have placed all the available
evidence in their reach, the question of
burden of proof does not arise. However, the
plaintiff, without proving his case, cannot
solely rely upon the lapse of non-production
of evidence by the defendant and argue that
adverse inference must be drawn against
the defendant for non-production of the
document.

In the present case, the
plaintiff/respondent had filed a suit for
specific performance of oral agreement by
the 1st defendant for the sale of two plots. In
the joint written statement, the oral
agreement for sale was admitted but the
receipt of entire sale consideration was

54 OS No.5985/1988

denied. Held, the Trial Court had grossly
misread the facts and evidence while coming
to a wrong conclusion that the plaintiff had
paid the entire sale consideration. The relief
should not have been granted on mere
technical assumption of burden of proof."

37. I have gone through the above said rulings relied

by the defendant No.1's counsel. The first ruling is pertaining

to the suit filed for relief of redemption of mortgage by

conditional sale or in the alternative for specific performance

of contract and the second ruling is pertaining to suit for

Specific performance of oral agreement. The case on hand is

suit for partition. As stated above in a suit for partition every

plaintiff is a defendant and every defendant is a plaintiff.

Though the evidence of PW1 and exhibits marked on behalf of

the plaintiffs cannot be considered in the absence not

producing General Power of Attorney by the plaintiffs

executed in favour PW1 but in view of the reasons stated

55 OS No.5985/1988

above and in the facts and circumstances of the case I am of

the opinion that they are not applicable to the case on hand.

38. So, from the discussions made above, I am of the

opinion that the plaintiffs proved that the suit schedule

properties are the ancestral and joint family properties of

Dodda Abbaiah and defendant No.1 and they are in joint

possession of the plaintiffs and defendant No.1 and the said

Dodda Abbaiah died in the year 1997 leaving behind him the

plaintiffs and the defendant No.1 failed to prove that the

plaintiff No.1 deserted the said Dodda Abbaiah and walked

out of his life for more than 45 years ago and she is not

entitle for share and item Nos.1 and 3 of the suit schedule

properties are the self acquired properties of the defendant

No.1 and the said Dodda Abbaiah relinquished his share in

the ancestral properties i.e. item Nos.2, 4 to 7 about 30 years

ago. Hence, Issue Nos.1 and 2 are answered in the

affirmative and Issue No.3 is answered partly in the

affirmative and Issue Nos.5 to 7 in the negative.

56 OS No.5985/1988

39. ISSUE NO.8: The defendant No.1 taken contention

that the suit is not properly valued. The defendant No.1 not

placed any materials on record in support of his contention.

On the other hand the valuation slip annexed with the plaint

shows that suit is valued the suit schedule properties for

Rs.40,205.50/- and the same has to be accepted in the

absence of contrary evidence placed by the defendant No.1 on

record. So, the plaintiffs valued the suit properly and the

defendant No.1 failed to prove that suit is not properly valued.

Hence, Issue No.8 is answered in the negative.

40. ISSUE NO.9: The defendant No.1 taken contention

in his written statement that the suit is bad for non-joinder of

necessary and proper parties as the alienee of item No.6 has

not been made as a party to the suit. In this regard, the

learned Advocate for the plaintiffs rightly relied on the ruling

reported in ILR 2012 KAR 4129(SK Lakshminarasappa, since

deceased by his L/Rs V/s B. Rudraiah and others) wherein it

is held that in a suit for partition at the stage of passing of

57 OS No.5985/1988

preliminary decree for partition the presence of alinee is not

necessary. Hence the presence of alinee of item no. 6 is not

necessary before this court and he is neither necessary nor

proper party to the suit. So issue No.9 is answered in the

negative.

41. ADDL. ISSUE NO.1 FRAMED ON 08.09.2000: It

is the case of the 2nd defendant that he is the bonafide

purchaser of item Nos.3 of the suit schedule properties under

the two registered sale deeds dated 12.2.1996 and 31.1.1996

for a valuable consideration and at that time the defendant

No.1 represented him the item No.3 is the ancestral property

of him and the said Dodda Abbaiah and he died issueless and

he was the sole surviving male successor and after

verification purchased it and he is not aware of any legal

proceedings pending.

42. The Defendant No.2 has not entered into the

witness box and thereby failed to prove that he the bonafide

58 OS No.5985/1988

purchaser of item No. 3 of the suit schedule property. Hence

Additional Issue No.1 framed on 08.09.2000 is answered in

the Negative.

43. ADDL. ISSUE NOs.1 TO 3 FRAMED ON

14.6.2011: It is the case of the plaintiffs that defendants No.1

and 2 have formed sites in suit properties and the lands in

suit item No.2, 4, 6 and 7 were acquired by the Karnataka

Industrial Areas Development Board - KIADB Bangalore and

the same is the part of the subject matter of L.A.C.No.47 of

2007 pending disposal before the City Civil Court, CCH.No.17

and the amount of compensation in respect of the acquired

lands will have to be partitioned amongst the plaintiffs and

the defendants, who are entitled to share the suit schedule

properties.

44. The evidence of DW1 shows that sites have been

formed and there is no dispute with respect to acquiring of

item Nos.2, 4 and 7 and depositing of compensation amount

59 OS No.5985/1988

in the court. Hence, these issues have to be considered in the

final decree proceedings. So, I answer Addl. Issues No.1 to 3

framed on 14.6.2011 as do not arise for consideration.

45. ISSUE NO. 4, 10 and 11 : In view of my findings

on Issue No. 1 to 3in the affirmative in favour of the

Defendant No. 1 the plaintiffs are jointly entitle for half

share in all items of suit schedule properties and mesne

profits from the date of the suit till the delivery of possession

of their respective share in the suit schedule properties.

Hence Issue No. 4, 10 to 11 are answered in the affirmative.

46. ISSUE NO. 12: In the result I proceed to pass the

following :
