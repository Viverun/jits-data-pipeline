5. The common facts as per all the three OAs are

as follows:-

5.1 The applicant on selection by Maharashtra

Public Service Commission was appointed as Deputy

Collector in the Revenue Service of the State of

Maharashtra w.e.f. 09.03.1994. On 03.03.2008, he was

9 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

served with the chargesheet with the allegations

that while working as District Rehabilitation

Officer in the year 2006 and on being appointed as

Returning Officer for Kalamnuri, Municipal Council,

District Hingoli, State of Maharashtra, as per the

State Election Commission's 2001 Symbol Allotment

Table, he had allotted Symbol 'The Car' to two

candidates who were contesting the said elections.

The applicant states that by then he had not

received any recent symbol table in which the said

symbol 'The Car' had been deleted. On 29.04.2009,

the applicant was promoted as Additional Collector

while the chargesheet referred above was still

pending against him. Thereafter, he was promoted to

the post of Additional Collector (Selection Grade)

37,000-67,000 with Grade Pay of Rs.8700/-. At the

time of filing of the present OA, he was posted as

Chairman/Additional Collector (Selection Grade)

Caste Scrutiny Committee, Ahmednagar vide order

dated 05.07.2016.

10 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

5.2 The applicant contends that being substantive

in the State Civil Service and having completed

eight years of continuous service in the post of

Deputy Collector, he is entitled for being

considered for appointment by promotion to the

Indian Administrative Service (IAS) as per Section

Regulation 5(2) third proviso which reads as under:

"Provided also that the Committee shall not consider the
case of a member of the State Civil Service unless, on the
first day of January of the year for which the Select List is
prepared he is substantive in the State Civil Service and has
completed not less than eight years of continuous service
(whether officiating or substantive) in the post of Deputy
Collector or in any other post or posts declared equivalent
thereto by the State Government."

5.3 Further as per Regulation 5(2), the Committee

shall consider for inclusion to the select list, the

cases of members of the State Civil Services in the

order of seniority in that service of a number which

is equal to three times the number referred in sub-

regulation (1).

5.4 The name of the applicant appeared at serial

No.56 in the seniority list of Deputy Collectors as

on 01.04.2009 published by the Government of

11 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

Maharashtra on 24.09.2009 whereas the names of

respondent Nos.4 to 6 appeared at serial Nos.57 to

59.

5.5 The select list of the year 2015 was being

considered by the respondents in the month of June,

2016. The applicant had submitted his unconditional

willingness for being appointed by promotion to IAS

vide declaration dated 16.01.2016 (Annex A-7).

However, his name was not considered in the select

list 2015 and he was declared as unfit. He was given

to understand that because of the pending

chargesheet against him, he was not considered for

appointment by promotion to IAS. He preferred

representations, dated 06.07.2016 (Annex A-8) to the

Secretary, DoPT and thereafter dated 06.07.2016

(Annex A-9)to the Chairman UPSC and dated 18.10.2016

(Annex A-10) to the Secretary, DoPT for

reconsideration of his case for appointment by

promotion to IAS by reviewing the Selection

Committee Meeting dated 20.06.2016.

12 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

6. The applicant was exonerated of the

chargesheet referred above vide order dated

27.11.2017. No adverse remarks or below benchmarks

were ever communicated to him, therefore, he ought

to have been appointed by promotion to IAS but

surprisingly his name again did not figure in the

select list of 2017 vide Notification dated

27.11.2018 (Annex A-1) and was again declared as

''unfit'. There was no response from the respondents

to his representation dated 12.12.2018 (Annex A-6)

for reviewing the Selection Committee Proceedings

dated 28.05.2018 and 31.10.2018 respectively. He

further states that since there was nothing adverse

on record against him, therefore, there was no

reason to exclude his name or to declare him as

'únfit' instead his name could be kept in a sealed

cover till grant of appropriate integrity

certificate to him by the appropriate authority.

6.1 The respondents Nos.4 to 8 who are junior to

him were promoted to IAS vide order dated 27.11.2018

13 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

which was challenged by him vide OA No.125/2019. The

said OA was disposed of by the Tribunal vide order

dated 14.02.2019 directing the respondents to

consider his representation dated 12.12.2018 and to

pass appropriate orders. The respondents rejected

the representation vide order dated 19.03.2019

(Annex A-2) on the grounds that since he was found

'unfit' by the Selection Committee, thus could not

be appointed by promotion to IAS.

7. OA No.426/2020 was filed by the applicant on

11.12.2020. Later on, with the permission of the

Tribunal, the same was amended vide order dated

06.07.2021. Vide this OA, he has challenged the

select list of the year 2018 issued vide Selection

Committee Proceedings dated 07.08.2020 followed by

Notification dated 03.09.2020. Vide these

proceedings, the applicant was again declared unfit

to be appointed by promotion to IAS cadre. The

applicant contends that the Minutes of the Selection

Committee Meeting do not disclose pendency of any DE

14 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

against the applicant or existence of any adverse

confidential remarks which are not expunged or

otherwise any adverse material that may have come to

the notice of the State Government and details of

which have been communicated to the Central

Government, pendency of any criminal proceedings or

withholding of certificate of integrity qua the

applicant.

7.1 The applicant contends that he has already

been exonerated in the DE proceedings. The single

ACR for the period of six months i.e. from

19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 which was graded as Average

has now been upgraded to Good vide order dated

27.03.2017. There was nothing adverse against the

applicant to his knowledge/communicated to him, so

therefore there was no occasion to exclude his name

from the select list for the year 2018.

7.2 Under RTI, the applicant sought the copy of

ACR for the year 2014-2015 which was B+ but was

never communicated to him in the regular course. The

15 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

same was placed before the UPSC Selection Committee

and forms the basis of rejection of his candidature,

as the consistent record required of an officer for

previous five years has to be A or A+ for

consideration for appointment to IAS by promotion.

The decision of the Selection Committee declaring

the applicant has unfit for Select List 2015, 2017

and 2018 respectively is termed as arbitrary,

illogical, unreasonable and illegal.

7.3 Reliance has been placed on the judgment of

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
Anil Kumar Vs.

Union of India & Ors
reported in MANU/SC/009/2019

whereby the Hon'ble Apex Court relying on its own

judgment of Dev Dutt's case held that 'consideration of an

ACR which is not communicated to the employee for purpose of determining

suitability of employee for promotion would render the decision bad in law

and liable to be set aside'.

8. The applicant seeks directions to the

respondents to call a review of the Selection

Committee meeting for Select List 2015, Select List

16 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

2017 and 2018 respectively and to consider his name

for appointment by promotion to IAS, if necessary,

to quash and set aside the impugned order dated

08.07.2016, 31.10.2018 and 07.08.2020. He further

seeks appointment by promotion to IAS with all

consequential reliefs including arrears of pay,

seniority etc. and to place him above the private

respondents.

9 Reliance has been placed on the judgment of

Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dev Dutt Vs. Union

of India & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.7631 of 2002)

contending that the adverse ACRs which were not

communicated to him, could not have been

considered while deciding his suitability for

appointment by promotion to IAS. His contention is

that all the last five years ACRs which are relevant

for the purposes of preparing the select list of

2018 are in his favour. He also quotes that the

candidates who have got their ACRs upgraded for two

or more years have also been considered positively

17 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

by the Selection Committee meeting and their names

feature in the final select list.

9.1 Reference has been made to G.R. dated

01.11.2011. Vide its instructions No.27(A) of the

said GR, the ACR is required to be mandatorily

communicated to the employee concerned before 30th of

June of the particular year, particularly, when the

ACRs have any adverse entries or an overall grade of

average or below which would affect negatively the

prospects of the employee being considered

favourably for promotion when due. The decision

dated 07.08.2020 of the Selection Committee Meeting

is apparently based on such ACR which has never

communicated to the applicant and, therefore, it

should not have been placed for consideration before

the Selection Committee. The applicant could not

have been declared unfit on the basis of

uncommunicated adverse ACR.

9.2 The applicant has further brought to our

notice that he had filed OA No.125/2019 in respect

18 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

of year 2017 which was disposed of vide order dated

14.02.2019 directing the respondents to consider the

representation of the applicant and to pass an

appropriate order. The respondents rejected the

representation vide order dated 19.03.2019 (Annex A-

8)without making any independent or fresh

application of mind. He filed further representation

dated 21.09.2020 for the year 2018. However, the

applicant has not been communicated any decision on

the same.

9.3 On getting this information under RTI that

his ACR for the year 2014-2015 was B+, he preferred

representations dated 01.02.2021 (Annex A-10) and

06.02.2021 to UPSC-Respondent No.2 against non-

communication of the ACR and consequential denial of

an opportunity to make representation for

reconsideration and upgradation of the ACR. The

same was forwarded by UPSC to the State Government

for appropriate action as per law. It is only,

thereafter, the applicant was provided with the copy

19 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

of ACR of 2014-2015 and was directed to submit

representation, if so desired, for upgradation. He

made representation dated 15.02.2021 for upgradation

of his ACR for the aforesaid period. Vide G.R. dated

30.03.2021 (Annex A-11), the department of Revenue

and Forest, Government of Maharashtra was pleased to

notify its decision to upgrade the said ACR (2014-

2015)from B+ to A Grade. The ACR for the year 2014-

2015 falls within the five year period for effecting

appointment by promotion to the IAS from officers in

State Service cadre for the years 2016 to 2018 which

are the subject matter of all the three OAs under

consideration.

9.4 The applicant has termed the decision taken

in the Selection Committee Meetings held on various

dates for the select years 2015, 2017 and 2018

declaring him 'unfit' for appointment by promotion

to the IAS as illegal being based on adverse ACRs

for the year 2012-2013 and 2014-2015, which were

never communicated to him. These ACRs have now been

20 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

upgraded, therefore, the applicant seeks quashing

and setting aside of the impugned selection

committee decisions dated 20.06.2016, 27.11.2018 &

07.08.2020 and for direction to conduct review of

selection committee meetings for all these years.

10. The respondent No.1 i.e. Union of India has

not filed reply to any of these OAs though Shri R.R.

Shetty regularly appeared in these cases and made

his oral submissions.

11. The respondent No.2 i.e. UPSC filed its

detailed reply to all the OAs admitting all the

facts of the case. However, it is submitted that the

UPSC discharge its functions and duties assigned to

it under
Article 320
of the Constitution. By virtue

of the provisions in the All India Service Act 1951,

separate Recruitment Rules have been framed for

IAS/IPS & IFS. In pursuance to these Rules, the

Regulations, 1955 have been framed. As per the

provisions of these regulations, the Selection

Committee presided over by the Chairman/Member of

21 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

the UPSC makes Selection from State Revenue

Service(SRS) officers for appointment to the IAS by

promotion.

11.1 As per the regulation 5(1) of Promotion

Regulations, the number of vacancies against which

the Selection is to be made for a particular Select

List for promotion to the IAS of a State Cadre is

determined by the Government of India(DoP&T) in

consultation with the State Government concerned.

Thereafter, the State Government forwards a proposal

to the Commission alongwith the seniority List,

Eligibility List of the State Revenue Service

officers, integrity certificate, certificates

regarding disciplinary/criminal proceedings

certificate regarding communication of adverse

remarks, details of penalties imposed on the

eligible officers etc. and complete ACR dossiers of

the eligible officers. These documents are then

examined by the Commission and placed before the

Selection Committee for preparation of Select List.

22 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

11.2 In accordance with the provisions of

Regulation 5(4), the Selection Committee classifies

the eligible State Revenue Service Officers included

in the zone of consideration as 'Outstanding', 'Very

Good', 'Good' or 'Unfit' as the case may be, on an

overall relative assessment of their service record.

11.3 Thereafter, as per the provisions of

Regulation 5(5), the Selection Committee prepares a

list by including the required number of names,

firstly from among the officers finally classified

as 'Outstanding', then from those who are classified

as 'Very Good' and thereafter from amongst those who

are classified as 'Good' while maintaining their

respective inter se seniority within each category.

11.4 The Selection Committee is not guided merely

by the overall grading that may be recorded in the

ACRs but makes its own assessment on the basis of

examination of service records of eligible officers,

deliberating on the quality of the officers on the

basis of his performance as reflected under various

23 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

columns recorded by the reporting officer/reviewing

officer/accepting authority in the ACRs for

different years and then finally arrives at the

classification to be assigned to each eligible

officer in accordance with provisions of promotion

regulations. The Selection Committee not only takes

into account orders regarding appreciation for

meritorious work done by the concerned officer but

also keeps in view orders awarding penalties or any

adverse remarks communicated to the officers, which

even after due consideration of his representation

have not been completely expunged.

11.5 As per provisions of Regulation 6 and 6A, the

State Government and Central Government are required

to furnish their observations to the Selection

Committee. The final decision is taken by the

Selection Committee under provisions of Regulation 7

after considering the observations of the State

Government and the Central Government and the

requisite records received from the State

24 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

Government. Finally, the appointments to the IAS are

made from the Select List by the Government of

India, DoPT.

11.6 In reply to OA No.768/2016, the respondent

No.2 stated that the applicant was assessed as

'Average' for two years i.e. 2012-2013 and 2014-2015

whereas he was assessed as 'Very Good' for the rest

of three years. On the basis of this yearwise

assessment, the Selection Committee overall assessed

him 'unfit' whereas the private respondents were

assessed as 'Very Good' for all the five years. On

the basis of the overall grading of the applicant

and the private respondents, the name of the

applicant was not included in the select list of

2015.

11.7. Regarding OA No.390/2019 and OA No. 426/2020,

again it is repeated by respondent No.2 that in the

Assessment Matrix of five years from 2012-2013 to

2016-2017 for the select list of 2017 and from 2013-

14 to 2017-18 for the Select list 2018, the

25 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

Selection Committee assessed him as 'unfit" due to

'Average' grading for the year 2014-15, therefore,

his name was not included in the Select List 2017 &

2018 whereas the name of six officers junior to him

who were overall assessed as 'Very Good' were

included in the select list.

12. In reply to OA No. 768/2016, respondent No.3

states that so far the promotion of the applicant to

the cadre of Additional Collector and Additional

Collector (Selection Grade) is concerned, the same

was subject to outcome of the departmental inquiry

according to the policy of General Administration

Department as per the Government circular dated

02.04.1976. It is stated that for the select list of

2015, the State Government had withheld the

integrity certificate of the applicant on account of

pending departmental inquiry which has now been

concluded and the applicant is acquitted of all the

charges vide Government order dated 27.11.2017.

12.1 Regarding the gradings obtained by the

26 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

applicant during the relevant period, it is stated

that the applicant had been graded as Average for

the period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012. Therefore, he

was not eligible for promotion to IAS. At the same

time, it is stated that the said gradation has been

upgraded as Good by Government order dated

27.03.2017 by expunging the adverse remarks.

Thereafter, the State Government sent the proposal

for promotion of applicant to the Indian

Administrative Service for select list of 2017 in

the light of his upgraded ACRs.

13. The respondent Nos.3 & 4 in reply to the OA

No.390/2019 have stated that the present OA is

devoid of merits.

14. In the rejoinder filed by the applicant to

the reply of respondents Nos.2, 3 & 4, it is

submitted that for the select list of the years 2015

to 2018, the relevant confidential reports were for

the years from 2009 onwards. He was communicated

with the ACR for the period from 19.06.2012 to

27 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

14.12.2012 as 'Average' by the respondent No.3 on

22.11.2016. UPSC took into consideration the said

adverse report which was never communicated to him

prior to holding of the Selection Committee Meeting

on 10.06.2016. The said ACR had now been upgraded to

'Good' vide communication dated 27.03.2017.

14.1 Similarly, the adverse ACR for the year 2014-

15 was not communicated to him but taken into

consideration by the UPSC during its meeting for the

Select Year 2017 and 2018 respectively. The same was

communicated to him after the Select Committee

Meeting 2018 and on the representation of the

applicant, the same has been upgraded as 'A' vide

order dated 30.03.2021.

15. We have heard the arguments addressed by

learned counsels for the parties.

16. Shri Deshmukh, learned counsel for the

applicant relies upon the G.R. dated 01.11.2011.

Vide instruction No.27(A) of the said G.R., the ACR

is required to be mandatorily communicated to the

28 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

employee concerned before 30th June of the year and

it is more so when the ACR has any adverse entries

or an overall grade of 'Average' or below which

would affect negatively the prospects of the

employee being considered favourably for promotion

when due. The G.R. lays down the procedure including

timelines for preparation and communication of ACR,

to hear the representation of the concerned employee

on the ACR and also deals with its upgradation.

Learned counsel has also argued that non

communicated adverse ACRs would be non est in the

eyes of law and cannot be considered against the

employees. He further argues that the decision of

the Selection Committee Meetings for the select

years 2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively are based on

ACRs which were though adverse but had not been

communicated to the applicant before respective

Selection Committee Meetings and the applicant had

not been given an opportunity to make

representations to the respondents for their

29 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

upgradation. Further, that all the ACRs which have

been communicated to him were either 'A' or 'A+',

therefore, the applicant could not have been

declared as 'unfit' in any of the Selection

Committee Meetings.

17. Shri Atre, learned counsel for the applicant

in OA No.768/2016 and 390/2019 has filed written

submissions in OA No.768/2016 and has brought to our

notice the Decision No.8(1) under 'Appointment by

Promotion', Regulations 1955 which makes it

mandatory for the State Government to furnish a

certificate to the Selection Committee that the

adverse remarks are communicated to the eligible

officer, whether any representation is received from

him or not and whether representation is received

within time but decision thereon is pending etc. He

further argues that the respondent No.3 had not

furnished the correct information to the Selection

Committee and therefore the adverse remarks against

the applicant were taken into consideration during

30 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

the relevant Selection Committee Meetings though in

fact these adverse remarks were never communicated

to the applicant and thus could not have been taken

into consideration against his interest. He relies

upon the following judgments:-

(
i) Dev Dutta Vs. Union of India
, 200(7) SCALE 403.

(
ii)Abhijit Ghosh Dastidar Vs. Union of India & Others
passed by the Hon'ble

Apex Court in Civil Appeal No.6227/2008 (arising out of SLP (C)

No.26556/2004.

(iii) Satya pal
Arora vs. Central Administrative Tribunal
decided by Hon'ble

Punjab & Haryana High Court vide Civil Writ Petition No.24614 of 2016

decided on 15.02.201.

(iv) Shri Appaso Balappa Dhulaj Vs. Union of India & 4 Ors., OA

No.2075/2017, decided by this bench itself vide order dated 11.04.2018

18. During the course of arguments, Shri Shetty

on behalf of Union of India, raised objection that

subsequent to the filing of OA No.768/2016, the ACR

for the period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 was upgraded

from Average to Good. However, the applicant has not

amended his OA, therefore, this fact cannot be taken

31 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

into consideration while disposing of this OA.

19. After hearing the submissions of learned

counsels for the parties, we have perused the record

carefully and have also gone through the relevant

judgments on the issue under consideration.

20. In the present case, the applicant has

challenged and sought quashing and setting aside of

the select lists for the years 2015, 2017 and 2018

respectively for the reason that in the Selection

Committee Meetings for all these years the adverse

entries against the applicant for the year 2012-2013

and 2014-2015, which were not communicated to him

and he had not been granted an opportunity to make

representation for expunging adverse remarks, were

taken into consideration and he was declared 'unfit'

for appointment by promotion to IAS. The respondent

Nos.3 & 4 admitted that these adverse entries were

communicated to the applicant after the meetings of

the Selection Committee for the select lists years

2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively. They submit that

32 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

on the representations of the applicant, these

adverse remarks have been expunged and his ACRs have

been upgraded. The ACR for the year 2012-2013 i.e.

for the period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 was

initially 'Average'. On his representation, it was

upgraded to 'Good' vide order dated 27.03.2017. The

applicant in his rejoinder has categorically

mentioned that this ACR was communicated to him by

the Govt of maharashtra on 22.11.2016 ie. after the

date of Select Committee Meeting for Select List

2015. Similarly, the ACR for the year 2014-2015 was

not communicated to him. He obtained information

under
RTI Act
and thereafter, during the pendency of

the present proceedings, he learnt that the ACR for

the period from 01.04.2014 to 31.03.2015 is B+,

which was never communicated to him before the same

was relied upon by the Select Committee in its

meeting for the Select List 2017-18. He applicant

made representation for its upgradation and

thereafter, it was upgraded from B+ to A grade vide

33 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

GR. Dated 30.03.2021.

21. It is painful to observe that both the

adverse ACRs ie. for the period for 19.06.2012 to

14.12.2012 and for the period 01.04.2014 to

31.03.2015, which were adverse to the applicant,

were never communicated to him and were made basis

for rejection of his candidature for appointment by

promotion to IAS.

22. It is settled proposition of law as per

various Supreme Court judgments that uncommunicated

adverse ACRs cannot be considered resulting in

denial of benefits to a Government Servant where

similar benefits are extended to his juniors. The

purpose of communication of adverse entries is to

give a warning to a Govt employee to improve his

performance. At the same time, it affords him

opportunity to explain his conduct so as to show

that adverse entry was unwarranted.

22.1 The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of

Amarkant Chaudhary Vs. State of Bihar (1984) 1 SCC

34 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

694 made the following observations in para 8 of the

judgment:-

"8. After giving our anxious consideration to the uncontroverted
material placed before us we have reached the conclusion that the
case of the appellant for promotion to the Indian Police Service
Cadre has not been considered by the Committee in a just and fair
way and his case has been disposed of contrary to the principles
laid down in Gurdial Singh Fijji's case (supra). The decisions of the
Selection Committee recorded at its meetings in which the case of
the appellant was considered are vitiated by reason of reliance
being placed on the adverse remarks which were later on expunged.
The High Court committed an error in dismissing the petition of the
appellant and its order is, therefore, liable to be set aside. We
accordingly set aside the order of the High Court. We hold that the
appellant has made out a case for reconsideration of the question of
his promotion to the Indian Police Service Cadre of the State of
Bihar as on December 22, 1976 and if he is not selected as on that
date for being considered again as on March 12, 1981. If he is not
selected as on March 12, 1981 his case has to be considered as on
October 14, 1981. The Selection Committee has now to reconsider
the case of the appellant accordingly after taking into consideration
the orders passed by the State Government subsequently on any
adverse entry that may have been made earlier and any other order
of similar nature pertaining to the service of the appellant. If on
such reconsideration the appellant is selected he shall be entitled to
the seniority and all other consequential benefits flowing
therefrom. We issue a direction to the respondents to reconsider the
case of the appellant as stated above. We hope that the above
direction will be complied with expeditiously but not later than
four months from today."

22.2 The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dev

Dutt (supra) is of the opinion that not only adverse

entries but every entry must be communicated to the

employee concerned so that he may have an

opportunity of making a representation against it if

he is aggrieved. Its non communication deprives the

35 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

employee of the opportunity of making a

representation against it which may effect his

chances of being promoted or to get some other

benefits. The Hon'ble Apex Court in this case made

the following observations in paras 11, 13, 14 & 39:

11. Hence, in our opinion, the 'good' entry should have been
communicated to the appellant so as to enable him to make a
representation praying that the said entry for the year 1993-94 should be
upgraded from 'good' to 'very good'. Of course, after considering such a
representation it was open to the authority concerned to reject the
representation and confirm the 'good' entry (though of course in a fair
manner), but at least an opportunity of making such a representation
should have been given to the appellant, and that would only have been
possible had the appellant been communicated the 'good' entry, which was
not done in this case. Hence, we are of the opinion that the non-

communication of the 'good' entry was arbitrary and hence illegal, and the
decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent are
distinguishable.

13. It has been held in
Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India & Anr.
AIR 1978
SC 597 that arbitrariness violates
Article 14
of the Constitution. In our
opinion, the non-communication of an entry in the A.C.R. of a public
servant is arbitrary because it deprives the concerned employee from
making a representation against it and praying for its up-gradation.

In our
opinion, every entry in the Annual Confidential Report of every employee
under the State, whether he is in civil, judicial, police or other service
(except the military) must be communicated to him, so as to enable him to
make a representation against it, because non-communication deprives the
employee of the opportunity of making a representation against it which
may affect his chances of being promoted (or get some other
benefits).Moreover, the object of writing the confidential report and making
entries in them is to give an opportunity to a public servant to improve his
performance, vide
State of U.P. vs. Yamuna Shankar Misra
1997 (4) SCC 7.
Hence such non-communication is, in our opinion, arbitrary and hence
violative of
Article 14
of the Constitution.

14. In our opinion, every entry (and not merely a poor or adverse entry)
relating to an employee under the State or an instrumentality of the State,
whether in civil, judicial, police or other service (except the military) must
be communicated to him, within a reasonable period, and it makes no
difference whether there is a bench mark or not. Even if there is no bench

36 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

mark, non-communication of an entry may adversely affect the employee's
chances of promotion (or getting some other benefit), because when
comparative merit is being considered for promotion (or some other
benefit) a person having a `good' or `average' or `fair' entry certainly has
less chances of being selected than a person having a `very good' or
`outstanding' entry.

39. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice
by holding that fairness and transparency in public administration requires
that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in the
Annual Confidential Report of a public servant, whether in civil, judicial,
police or any other State service (except the military), must be
communicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a
representation for its upgradation. This in our opinion is the correct legal
position even though there may be no Rule/G.O. requiring communication
of the entry, or even if there is a Rule/G.O. prohibiting it, because the
principle of non-arbitrariness in State action as envisaged by
Article 14
of
the Constitution in our opinion requires such communication.
Article 14

will override all rules or government orders."

The law
laid down by
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the

case of Dev Dutt(supra) has been followed in the

case of Sukhdev Singh vs. union of
India (2013) 9

SCC 566, Abhijeet Ghosh Dastidar vs. Union of India

(
2009) 16 SCC 146 and Anil Kumar & Ors vs

UOI
(supra).

23. In the present case, the action of Respondent

Nos. 3 and 4 in not communicating the ACR for the

period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012(2012-13) and

01.04.2014 to 31.03.2015(2014-15) in our opinion is

arbitrary and violative of principles of natural

justice. Due to such inaction of respondents, the

37 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

applicant was declared as unfit for appointment by

promotion to IAS for the Select List 2015, 2017 and

2018 respectively, without affording him an

opportunity to make representation against the

adverse ACRs. Even UPSC ought have not considered

the adverse entries against the applicant, without

verifying as to whether the adverse entries in the

ACRs were communicated to him, whether he had made

any representation thereon, and if so, what is the

outcome of the representation, particularly, when

the State Govt had withheld the issuance of

integrity certificate.

24. Shri Shetty has argued that after the

upgradation of ACRs for the period 19.06.2012 to

14.12.2012, from B to B+, the applicant ought have

amended OA No. 768/2016. Since, he has not amended

the OA, this fact cannot be taken into consideration

while passing final order. However, we are not

impressed by this argument as admittedly the

applicant had not been communicated with the adverse

38 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

ACR against him at the relevant time and therefore,

the same ought not have been taken into

consideration during the Selection Committee Meeting

affecting the applicant adversely. Since the

respondents have now brought this fact on record

that the said ACR has already been upgraded from

Average to Good, therefore, this fact is already

noticed by this Tribunal while taking judicial note

of the same.

25. After giving thoughtful consideration to the

undisputed material on record, we are of the opinion

that the Selection Committee has not considered the

case of the applicant for appointment by promotion

to the IAS in just and fair manner. The Selection

Committee's decisions in its meetings held for

Select List 2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively stand

vitiated as these were based on adverse ACRs which

were never communicated to the applicant.

Admittedly, later on, the adverse remarks have been

expunged. The applicant has squarely made out a

39 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

case for reconsideration of the question of his

appointment by promotion to the IAS. In the

circumstances, the decision of the Selection

Committee in its meetings dated 08.07.2016,

27.11.2018 and 07.08.2020, qua the applicant

declaring him unfit are quashed and set aside. The

respondents are directed to constitute Review

Selection Committee for the Select List 2015, 2017

and 2018 and to consider afresh the case of

applicant for appointment by promotion to the IAS

taking into consideration the orders passed by the

State Govt recalling the adverse entries in the ACR

and upgrading the same. If, on such consideration,

the applicant is not selected for the Select List

2015, he be considered for the Select List 2017.

Again, if he is not selected, his case be considered

for the Select List 2018. If on such

reconsideration, the applicant is selected, he shall

be entitled to the seniority and all other

consequential benefits. The respondents are directed

40 OA Nos.768/2016,

390/2019 & 426/2020

to comply with these directions positively within 8

weeks. In view of the above directions, OA Nos.

768/2016, 390/2019 and 426/2020 stand disposed off.

No order as to costs.
