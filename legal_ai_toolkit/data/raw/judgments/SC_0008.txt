COMMON ORDER

A. The Petitions:

These two matters arise under of the same case and as such, they are

taken up, heard, and disposed of by this common order.

1.1. In Crl.O.P.No.30939 of 2024, the petitioners are (i) M/s. Truedom

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

EPC India Pvt. Ltd., (ii) T.Elayaraja, (iii) T.Arivunithi, and (iv) T.Selvamani,

who are named as accused 1 to 4 in C.C.No.2358 of 2024.

1.2. (i) Ravichandran, (ii) M/s. True Value Homes India Pvt. Ltd., and

(iii) M/s. TVH Energy Resource Pvt. Ltd. are the petitioners 1 to 3 in

Crl.O.P.No.30938 of 2024, and they are arrayed as accused 6 to 8 in

C.C.No.2358 of 2024.

B. The Brief Facts:

2. The case of the prosecution is that between 2013 and 2016, all the

accused conspired to cheat the Indian Overseas Bank. They applied for and

received a Rs.30 Crores term loan by making false representations to the

Bank, leading it to believe that the 1st accused, M/s Truedome EPC India Pvt.

Ltd., was engaged in genuine wind energy projects. As a result, the loan was

approved on 28.03.2013, and the amount was disbursed on 30.03.2013 into

the loan account No. 0060 0327 1300 007 of the 1st accused company.

2.1. On the same day, the 4th accused, representing the 1st accused,

submitted a letter to the Chief Manager of Indian Overseas Bank, requesting

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

the transfer of funds to three different firms: M/s Ecodome Power Pvt. Ltd.,

M/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., and M/s Sri Balaji Traders, amounting

to Rs.13.5 Crores, Rs.12.5 Crores, and Rs.4 Crores respectively. Accordingly,

the funds were transferred to these entities. The Director of M/s Ecodome

Power Pvt. Ltd. is the 4th accused, and another Director, Mr. Arun Nehru, is

the elder brother's son of the 6th accused, N. Ravichandran, who is the

Managing Director of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. The company M/s

Ecodome Power Pvt. Ltd. did not conduct any business or utilize the funds in

relation to the wind turbine generator project with M/s Trishe Renewable

Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. However, the entire amount was transferred to the

account of the 7th accused, M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd.

2.2. Similarly, M/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., in whose favour

Rs.12.5 Crores was transferred, did not have any proper business and

transferred this amount to the account of the 7th accused - M/s True Value

Homes Pvt. Ltd. M/s Sri Balaji Traders also transferred Rs.2 Crores into the

accounts of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. and another Rs.2 Crores to M/s

TVH Energy Resources Pvt. Ltd. The majority of the funds pooled into the

account of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. was used on the same day, i.e.,

5/44

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

30.03.2013, to settle its term loan with M/s Punjab National Bank.

Additionally, Rs.28.08 Crores, out of the loan amount sanctioned by Indian

Overseas Bank, was used for this purpose.

2.3. Thereafter, even though the original sanction terms were amended

and the initial holiday period of one year was extended to two years, in 2016,

the loan account became a Non-Performing Asset. Subsequently, by a

communication dated 18.11.2019, the 1st accused – Company was required to

pay Rs. 31.5 Crores as a one-time settlement. The settlement amount was to be

paid in two installments: Rs. 21.50 Crores on or before 15.12.2019 and Rs. 10

Crores on or before 15.01.2020. The One Time Settlement sanction letter was

issued on 29.11.2019. The 1st accused did not adhere to this, and

consequently, after receiving another request letter from the 2nd accused – T.

Elayaraja, the bank issued a revised OTS proposal for a full and final

settlement of Rs. 33.42 Crores, including the delayed period interest of Rs.

1.91 Crores, to be paid on or before 30.09.2021. After obtaining an extension,

a sum of Rs. 8.34 Crores of the OTS amount was paid on time, but the

remaining amounts were not paid within the stipulated period.

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

2.4. At this juncture, a complaint was forwarded by the Bank on

24.12.2021, based on which a case was registered in R.C.No.032/2021 A 0022

for alleged offences under Section 420, and 120B read with
Section 420
of

IPC. During the investigation of the complaint, the Indian Overseas Bank

agreed to accept a further delayed period interest of Rs.2,67,68,876.75/- over

and above the amount already due, and the 1st accused paid the sum of

Rs.25.08 Crores on 11.05.2022. Thereafter, the Indian Overseas Bank

calculated an additional Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, which was

paid and accepted as full and final settlement on 23.02.2023, and a no-

objection certificate was issued by the Bank stating that the loan account was

entirely cleared. It is at this stage, on 22.08.2024, that the present final report

was laid and taken on file as C.C.N.2358 of 2024 before the Additional Chief

Metropolitan Magistrate, Chennai, and summons were issued to the accused.

All the accused except the accused No. 5 are before this Court.

C.The Submissions:

3. Heard M r . V i j a y a Na r a y a n , Mr.Sankaran ar ay an an, and M r . O m

Pr ak a s h , the learned Senior Counsel, who argued the matter in detail. Since

their arguments overlap, they are summarized point wise.

7/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

3.1. First, they would submit that on a perusal of the transactions and

even as per the final report, except
Section 120-B
IPC for which no specific

material was placed on record, the only other offence being under
Section 420

of IPC, is compoundable in nature. The alleged transactions does not make out

an offence under
Section 420
of IPC, in as much as for a term loan of Rs.30

Crores, a property ad-measuring 53,540 sq.ft in Old No.15 & 16, New Door

No.55 at Dr.Muthulakshmi Salai, also known as Lattice Bridge Road, Adyar,

Chennai – 600 020 was given as security by the guarantor, viz., M/s Vicoans

Infrastructure and Environment Engineering Pvt. Ltd., which is the owner of

the property and the accepted valuation report of the valuers approved by the

bankers, estimated the fair market value of the property as Rs.128.30 Crores,

even as on 23.03.2013. A mortgage deed was duly executed. Therefore, in this

case, it can never be argued by the prosecution that there was an intention to

cheat the bank, at the inception. Like every other default loan account, after

the loan was serviced for some time, thereupon, it became a Non Performing

Asset and the proceedings were pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal.

8/44

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

3.2. In the year 2019, an OTS proposal has been granted and had the

Company paid the OTS within the first deadline itself, even the compliant

would not have emanated from the Bank. Even after extension of time, the 1 st

accused – Company was able to make only a part payment, the complaint

emanated from the Bank. But once the Bank extended the time and the entire

OTS amount was settled amicably, which included the belated payment of

interest, absolutely no offence under
Section 420
of IPC ever made out and

therefore, the transactions firstly are completely civil in nature. Criminal

colour was sought to be given by mentioning the purpose for which the loan

was sought and the purpose of which the loan was used. Even then, it is the

contention of the learned Senior Counsel that the loan itself was granted under

the insta fund scheme, which is based more on the security rather than the

purpose of business.

3.3. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that the further

investigation does not reveal that the Company had never entered into any

agreement with the concerned entities, nor does it suggest that the Company

was not engaged in the business of wind energy. The only allegation, which

9/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

has been raised belatedly, appears to be that the part payment under the One-

Time Settlement (OTS) was not made, and that the funds were allegedly

diverted to the group concern, namely, the 7 accused. Thus, the action, though
th

potentially questionable as 'fraud' within the meaning of the circular issued by

the Reserve Bank of India for the purpose of classifying the account as

fraudulent, does not, by itself, constitute a criminal offence, as fraud under

such circulars is not synonymous with cheating as defined under criminal law.

Thus, either at the inception of the transaction or when the transactions

concluded by a memorandum of understanding by way of OTS finally, by

paying the interest on belated payment, no offence under
Section 420
of IPC

was made out and therefore, the complaint is liable to be quashed.

3.4. The learned Senior Counsel would further submit that when the

bank has received the amount towards full and final settlement and the matter

amicably settled between the parties and the bank is not claiming any further

amount due, by the dicta of the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of

India in this regard, this Court should exercise the power under
Section 482
of

the Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the case, as the proceedings are

predominantly civil in nature, and considering the commercial wisdom, the

bank has settled the transactions and it would be oppressive on the accused to

10/44

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

continue the prosecution. In any event, when the cause of action itself has

arisen on account of the part non-payment of the OTS amount, the same

subsequently being paid and the bank accepting the same as full quit by

adding another Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, the possibility of

further prosecution is very bleak, and therefore, on that score also, the case is

liable to be quashed.

3.5.
In support of their submissions for the proposition that the

classification of the fraudulent account is violative of principles of natural

justice, and the consequential FIR should be quashed, the Judgment of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
State Bank of India and Others Vs.

Rajesh Agarwal and Others1
, is relied upon. To contend that the ingredients

of
Section 420
of IPC are not made out in the instant case, the following four

Judgments are relied upon:

Sl. Citation Case Name
No.
1. (2021) 18 SCC 70 N.Radhavender Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh,
CBI
2. (2024) SCCOnLine SC 339 A.M.Mohan Vs. State represented by SHO &

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

Sl. Citation Case Name
No.
3.6. For the proposition that in view of the amicable settlement of the

loan amount, this Court should exercise the power under
Section 482
of the

Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings, the following

Judgments were relied upon:

Sl. Citation Case Name
No.
1.
(
2014) 5 SCC 364 CBI Vs. Narendra Lal Jain & Ors
.

2. (
2024) SCCOnLine SC 2696 Tarina Sen Vs. Union of India & Anr
.

3. (
2024) SCCOnLine Del Lalit Kishore & Ors. Vs. CBI & Anr
.
4. (2025) SCCOnLine SC 788 Suresh V. Singal & Ors Vs. State of Gujarat &
Ors.

5. (
2025) SCCOnLine SC 1257 N.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police &
Anr
.

3.7. Per contr a, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on

behalf of the 1 respondent - CBI would submit that the proposition that once
st

the loan amount is subsequently settled, this Court should quash the case is

incorrect in law. Even though in some individual cases the proceedings are

quashed, the law
laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Gian

12/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

Singh's case (cited supra) and in other Judgments have been followed till

date. Therefore, if the transactions are such amounting to grave fraud,

especially in financial matters, when the loan amount is as large as Rs.30

Crores in the instant case, the Court should not interfere with the matter.

3.8. In the instant case, the facts are alarming. After representing to the

bank that they are going to conduct a business relating to wind energy, on the

same day, within hours, the entire loan amount has been siphoned off to other

shell entities and ultimately transferred to the 7 accused, for the purpose of
th

repayment of loan to another bank. The said conduct has to be taken into

account by this Court. Further, the loan was not repaid, thus the account

became NPA. When a false representation is made, inducing the bank to part

away with a loan amount of Rs.30 Crores and subsequently when the accused

did not repay the same and cheated, the offence under
Section 420
of IPC was

made out, and merely because subsequently the amount has been repaid will

not undo the offence and considering the nature of transactions, this is not a fit

case for interference by this Court.

3.9. In this case, on a perusal of the memorandum of understanding

entered into at the time of OTS, it can be seen that the bank has specifically

13/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

stated that the existing criminal cases will continue and therefore, there is no

question of quashing this case on compromise. In support of his submissions,

the learned Special Public Prosecutor would rely upon the following

Judgments:

Sl. Citation Case Name
No.
1.
(
2013) 10 SCC 686 Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Jagjit Singh

2.

(2014) 15 SCC 29 State of Maharashtra through

5. (2023) SCC OnLine Mad Eventus Integrated Management Pvt. Ltd. Vs.
2712 State, Inspector of Police and Another

6. Crl.O.P.No.16754 of 2024 M/s Springfield Shelters Pvt. Ltd. And Ors. Vs.
Deputy Superintendent of Police and Ors.

3.10. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would also rely upon the

Judgment in
Kothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI2
to contend that

even if the case is to be quashed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had

imposed appropriate costs, so as to cover the possible expenses.

3.11. M s . V . R a j e s w a r i , the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd

respondent – Bank, at the outset would submit that it is true that pursuant to

2 (2022) SCC Online SC 2078

14/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

the OTS the entire amount was settled and that no further amount is claimed

by the Bank. However, while entering into the OTS amount, since the bank

had to forego a portion of the notional amount due, even though the Bank had

realised the book amount due and the belated payment interest, the Bank had

not expressly undertaken to withdraw the criminal complaint, and therefore,

though there is a settlement of the account with reference to the loan

transaction, there is no express clause for compromise regarding the criminal

case. The Bank thus takes a position to that extent.

3.12. Mr.N.Ramesh, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on

behalf of the Enforcement Directorate would submit that the Enforcement

Directorate has also registered an ECIR under the
Money Laundering Act,
, based on the present predicate offences and would take the same stand

as the CBI.

4. I have considered the rival submissions made on either side and

perused the material records of the case.

D.The Questions:

5. The following questions arise for consideration in the instant case:-

15/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

(i) Whether the final report filed in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be

quashed as no offence under
Section 420
of IPC is ever made out ?

(ii) Whether the final report in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be

quashed on account of the fact that subsequently the entire loan amount was

settled through OTS scheme with the Bank ?

E.Question No.(i):

6. On a plain reading of
Section 420
of IPC and the Judgments that are

relied upon, which are cited supra on the propositions it would be clear that,

(a) the primary ingredient is that there must be a deception of a person.

(b) The person should have been fraudulently or dishonestly induced to

deliver any property belonging to him.

(c) The same should have been done with an intention to cheat that a

person, at the time of inducement itself.

6.1. In this case, the letter dated 11.03.2013 of the 1 st accused is stated

to be the application for sanction of the loan of Rs.30 Crores. It is a three-page

communication. It first details about the 1st accused – Company and its

Directors. Thereafter, it details about the business that it is engaged in,

16/44

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )
Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

windmill, turbines and towers. Further, it details about the project executed by

the company with an organization, viz., M/s. Liatenat Sriram. It further states

that they have availed credit facilities from Indian Bank for the 49.50 MW

project being a overdraft facility of Rs.26.80 Crores, by offering collateral

security with a market value of Rs.44.73 Crores. Though, the project is

completed by making investments and the other approvals were also in place,

there was a problem with reference to the grid connectivity by the Tamil Nadu

Electricity Board, as otherwise, they would have earned a profit of more than

Rs.30 Crores. But the profit is restricted to only Rs.1.15 Crores in the said

project. They have also completed another 30 MW project.

6.2. It is further stated that they have now bagged two more contracts

worth about Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions

Pvt. Ltd. for setting up 100.80 MW project at Moolanur in Tiruppur District.

They have already infused a sum of Rs.13.67 Crores to execute the said works

and for servicing the overall facility with Indian Overseas Bank. Thus, their

business prospects look very bright and therefore they need funds to augment

their working capital position. Stating so, they sought the present limit for

execution of the two fresh contracts, promising that all transactions will be

routed through the current account maintained with the Indian Overseas Bank

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

and an immovable property security at Nallambakkam village was also

initially offered. It is essential to extract the relevant portion of the said

application which reads thus:-

“The Company had already completed 30 MW of setting
up of windmills for Shriram Lietner and Regen Power tech and
has hands on experience on the field. The profits earned on these
contracts were retained in the business and are used to service the
existing loan and a part of the profit was utilized for executing the
49.50 MW of Shriram Lietner contract. The promoters have
bagged a further two contracts worth Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s
Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions Private Limited for setting up
100.80 MW comprising of 48 nos. at Moolanoor, Tirupur
District.

The promoters have already infused Rs.13.67 Crores to
execute the works and for servicing the facility with Indian Bank.
As explained they have bagged the referred two contracts, which
shall infuse some cashflow to the system. Further the present
limit is sought for execution of the two fresh contracts. In the past
for executing the 30 MW contracts (2 nos), all the transactions
were routed through the current account maintained with Indian
Overseas Bank, which goes to speak about our efficiency of
executing the contract.

As our growth in business and prospects look very bright,
we need to go in for bank support to augment our working capital
position.

We enclose our Balance sheet as also financial
projections. We request you to sanction us a MCC limit of Rs.30
Crores to meet the mismatch in our cash flows. We shall offer
adequate security of land situated at Nallambakkam village
standing in the name of the partnership firm, where Shri
T.Elayaraja is a partner.”

6.3. Though it can be seen from the above that there was no categorical

statement as if they were going to use the funds only to the transactions with

M/s Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd., still it points out that it is

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

for their working capital purposes. But the entire amount was transferred to

their three group Concerns, within hours, who in-turn again, transferred

almost the entire amount, to 7th accused, for the purpose of repaying the loan.

From the materials, it is clear that a false representation was made to the Bank,

with reference to the purpose for which the funds will be used. Therefore,

there is a deception.

6.4. It can be contended on behalf of the Bank that only on the

representation that the 1st accused will utilise the funds for its own purposes,

the loan amount was parted. It is true that a security of almost four times of

the loan amount was given and a mortgage deed was also executed. But at the

same time, it has to be seen that after making a representation and taking away

the money, the loan amount was not repaid in time. The Bank took action

under the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and

Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002
("
SARFAESI Act
") to auction the

secured asset, but it is stated before this Court that in spite of five attempts, the

property could not be sold, as there were no bidders. It is stated that on

account of the same, an OTS settlement was entered into considering the

commercial prudence. Even though originally time was granted, the OTS

amount was not paid in time. Even after the second extension of time, only the

part-payment of Rs.8.34 Crores was made and the major amount remained

unpaid and once the deception was made and the amounts were parted and the

same was not paid and the security not being sold; the OTS amount has not

been realized; on the day of forwarding the complaint, the Bank was at a loss.

Therefore, the offence under
Section 420
of IPC was prima facie made out.

6.5. The contention on behalf of the accused that there was no other

impediment to the sale of the secured asset, and regarding the circumstances

under which the mortgaged property was not sold, and whether the Bank had

actually reduced the upset price of the property in accordance with the rules if

there were no bidders, are to be further examined. It is also submitted that

there was a dispute regarding the portion of the property. On the face of it, the

offence under
Section 420
of IPC is made out, and to contend that no offence

is made out would require an exercise of appreciating and further evaluating

the evidence that would come on record, including the defence version;

therefore, this question is answered in favour of the prosecution and against

the petitioners. It cannot be said that there are not materials at all to proceed

for the offences under Section 120-B read with 420 of
IPC
and Section 420

essential to consider the legal position before moving to the facts of the

Hon’ble supreme court of India held that
basically it was a matter of civil dispute
since the bank has already filed suits and the
issue was compromised upon receiving
payments and considering the time lack that
the First Information report lodged in the
year 1987 and no action has been taken as
against the erring official of the bank the
High Court was right in quashing the FIR.

certain documents are forged to have been
created by the company in order to avail
credit facilities beyond the limit to which the
company was actually entitled to, the dispute
has overtone of a civil dispute with certain
criminal facets. The court held that in view

and considered the issue in detail. Firstly, it
held that the line of Judgments holding the
view that when
section 320
of Code of
Criminal Procedure,1973 holds only certains
offences can be compoundable then if non
compoundable offences are quashed under
section 482 the same would run counter to
section 320 and therefore the inherent
powers should not be exercised in violation
of section 320 is not a correct legal position.
It held that the exercise of power namely
Compounding and quashing under section
482 are different exercises and section 320
will not bar the exercise of power.

It
expressly held that the view taken in

cannot be quashed. Even the victim or the
victim’s family settled the issues. Similarly
compromise between victim and the
offender under Special law of Prevention of

the public servant cannot be quashed. The
criminal cases having overwhelmingly and
predominantly civil flavor particularly of
they arise from commercial financial
mercantile civil partnership are like

that the law regarding the quashing of criminal cases involving non-

compoundable offences, where parties allege settlement, has been clearly laid

down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Gian Singh
's case (cited

supra). It is essential to refer to paragraph Nos. 58 and 61 of that judgment:

“58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding
having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender
and the victim has been settled although the offences are not
compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of
criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in
the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an
end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the
ultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have
harmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that
seriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society
and it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the
victim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has
been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made
compoundable in law, with or without the permission of the
court. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity,
etc., or other offences of mental depravity under
IPC
or offences
of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the
Prevention of
Corruption Act
or the offences committed by public servants
while working in that capacity, the settlement between the
offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all.
However, certain offences which overwhelmingly and
predominantly bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,
mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like
transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly
relating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is
basically to the victim and the offender and the victim have
settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the
fact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the
High Court may within the framework of its inherent power,
quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it
is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any
likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing
the criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of
justice shall be defeated. The above list is illustrative and not
exhaustive. Each case will depend on its own facts and no hard-

and-fast category can be prescribed.

......

61. The position that emerges from the above discussion
can be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in
quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise
of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power
given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under
Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude
with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord
with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the
ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any
court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or
complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the
victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and
circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.

However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must
have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous
and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,
rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the
victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the
dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a
serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between
the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under
special statutes like the
Prevention of Corruption Act
or the
offences committed by public servants while working in that
capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal
proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases
having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand
on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly
the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,
partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of
matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where
the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties
have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the
High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view,
because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,
the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation
of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression
and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by
not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete
settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the
High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary
to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to
abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise
between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the
ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an
end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the
affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to
quash the criminal proceeding.”

7.3. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the High Court will be

well within its jurisdiction to quash the proceedings on compromise, if the

offence is predominantly civil in nature, private in nature, completely settled

between the parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the

proceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would be oppressive

on the accused to be continued, even after settlement. The power is to be

exercised with a great amount of prudence and responsibility, to secure the

ends of justice.

7.4. However, the question regarding the instances of various frauds

committed by parties concerning banking transactions, obtaining loans, and

defaulting on and subsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with

the bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the

cases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were quashed, while in others,

they were not. But a proper and combined reading of all the judgments cited

above related to this subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion

35/44

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

reached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the particular offence,

such as 468, 471 of
IPC
, or offences under Section 120 B read with 420 of

IPC
which is paramount. Instead, it is the nature of the allegations that the

Court must examine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each case,

one has to determine whether the case involves a purely commercial or private

transaction between the bank and the borrower, or if it has broader

implications affecting society or the financial system as a whole.

7.5. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances must be

examined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the case is primarily

commercial or civil in nature and that the criminal aspects are not of utmost

depravity and seriousness, which could have a likely impact on society as a

whole or the country's financial system. The second step involves assessing

whether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank has any

remaining claims. If the case has reached a complete and final settlement and

the bank has no pending claims, then the Court moves to the third step to

evaluate whether continuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed

in prosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider whether

continuing the proceedings would be unfair, oppressive, or constitute an abuse

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

of the legal process, considering the nature of the settlement or compromise,

the circumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the accused, the time

elapsed, and the stage at which quashing is requested. In the interest of justice,

the Court may, in fit cases, decide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate

cases, costs can also be imposed.

G.The consideration and findings:

8. Now, addressing the facts of this case, the following are relevant for

consideration:

(i) The loan amount was Rs. 30 Crores, which was quite a high amount

in 2013 when the borrowing took place.

(ii) Before the default in payment, the primary wrongful act of the

accused was that when they needed funds to immediately repay a loan taken

by the seventh accused company from Punjab National Bank, they dishonestly

obtained a loan in the name of the first accused company, falsely claiming it

was for working capital. They used the money to repay the loan on the same

day, routing it through three entities controlled by them, which had no actual

business.

(iii) The loan was granted without adhering to certain norms. After

disbursal, no inspection was carried out to verify the purpose for which the

funds were used, even though the bank officials transferred the funds in three

tranches within hours of disbursement, leading to the loan being repaid to

another bank. Following a default, an original application was filed for

recovery of the amount due, and SARFAESI action was initiated. Although

the secured asset is a property in a prime location in Chennai, it is stated that

there were no bidders five times due to a dispute over a minor part of the

property. It is unclear if the upset price was lowered for subsequent auctions.

When a one-time settlement was offered despite the default, the bank did not

treat the offer as withdrawn, unlike in other cases, but granted two extensions

after payment of revised amounts. Despite the valuable security, a One-Time

Settlement (OTS) was approved due to an expected delay of about a year in

recovering the amount through auction. From the collected materials, it

appears that Regional Office officials (LW-2 & 3) blame the Branch Managers

for norm violations during the loan approval, while the Branch Official (LW-

21) claims that the Regional Office handled the entire process because of the

high value of the application.

(iv) There is no evidence that the petitioners conspired with or paid any

quid pro quo to any of the bank's officials, and the bank did not file any

complaint against its officers. Nor did the CBI uncover any evidence against

public servants; only the companies and their directors are prosecuted for

offences under Section 120(B) read with 420 and 420 of
IPC
, with the only

non-compoundable offence being 120(B)of
IPC
.

(v) The matter was amicably resolved between the parties through the

memorandum of settlement, and the relevant portions read as follows:

“9. A n y Suit/ C l a i m/ C o m p l a i n t filed by the
B o r r o w e r s/ G u a r a n t o r s again st the Ba n k sho ul d be withd r a w n
befo r e rele a s e of the secu r iti e s.

10. This co m p r o m i s e settle m e n t will not have any beari n g
what s o e v e r on the ong o i n g crim i n a l case s/pr o c e e d i n g s , if any
pen di n g the court s again st the B o r r o w e r/ G u a r a n t o r s .

11. Br a n c h sho ul d ensu r e that all the secu r itie s are insur e d
for full value till the full realis ati o n of the O T S am o u n t.

12. This settle m e n t will not affect our Ba n k ’ s right and
oblig a ti o n to shar e any infor m a t i o n in the cou r s e of any crim i n a l
pro c e e d i n g s (if any), or to provi d e con s e n t for crim i n a l
pro c e e d i n g s in case so dire ct e d by any statut o r y auth o r it y. ”

Thus, it can be observed that a cumulative reading of the above, along with

other clauses in the memorandum of settlement, indicates there will be no

further complaints; however, if any ongoing prosecution exists, it will not be

withdrawn. Clearly, it can be seen that the bankers, although able to settle the

matter amicably, cannot withdraw the complaint or promise to do so, since the

offences are non-compoundable; hence, such clauses are included. But at that

time, no prosecution was pending. Time was extended, and the amount was

revised on the same terms. However, before the final amount was paid, the

Bank filed the complaint in view of the default in payment within the time

extended.

(vi) Before this Court, the bank is not outrightly admitting that the issue

has been compromised with reference to the criminal case. It states that it had

to forgo a portion of its notional outstanding when it settled the issue with the

petitioners. It is observed that the original borrowal as on 28/03/2013 was 30

crores. When the account became NPA on 30/06/2016, the outstanding,

including interest and penal interest, was Rs. 27,12,79,620/-. On 27/12/2018,

the DRT-II passed a decree for Rs . 37,96,49,463/-. The original OTS was

sanctioned for Rs. 31.50 crores. Since it was not paid in time, the OTS was

accepted again with delayed period interest. It is stated that the Book

outstanding as on 31/12/2020 is Rs. 24,98,39,153/-. Against the Notional

Dues up to Rs. 31/03/2021, amounting to Rs. 38,88,89,946/-, the OTS was

accepted at Rs. 33,41,58,904/-. After this offer, Rs. 8.34 crores was paid in

time, but the remaining balance was not paid, leading to the lodging of this

First Information report. The balance was paid on 11/05/2022, including

further delayed interest of Rs. 37 Lakhs, which the bank accepted, and a NOC

was issued on 23/02/2023. Subsequently, on 22/08/2024, the instant final

report was filed.

40/44

Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024

(vii) The bank agrees that no additional amount is due and payable on

behalf of the petitioners/accused and NOC has already been issued.

(viii) In the absence of any other material, the complaint itself was

triggered only due to partial payment and non-payment of the balance amount

accepted during one-time settlement, and as such, it would be a challenge for

the prosecution to prove the intention to cause loss to the bank, especially at

the inception of the transaction.

8.1. Thus, after weighing all the facts, the balance would tilt in favour

of accepting the petitioners' prayer by quashing the case based on an amicable

settlement of the dues to the bank. The enforcement directorate also did not

record any other allegations, and the learned counsel adopted only the

objections raised by the prosecution. Since the entire loan amount was used to

repay the loan of the group company to another bank on the same day, and it is

clear that bank officials were aware of this from the start, with another bank

realising the amount due, this tilts the case more towards a commercial

consideration and does not demonstrate a serious offence against society.

8.2. At the same time, considering the amount involved and the time
