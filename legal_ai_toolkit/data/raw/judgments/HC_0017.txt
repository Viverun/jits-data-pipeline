No.396/2024, registered by the Vallikkunnam Police

Station, Alappuzha. In Crime Nos.865/2024 and 876/2024

registered by the Koipuram Police Station,

Pathanamthitta against which B.A.Nos.7919/2024 and

7921/2024 are filed, there are only three accused in the

crime. Since all these applications are filed by the same

petitioners, the applications were consolidated, jointly

heard, and are being disposed of by this common order.

2. The common case of the de-facto complainants

in the respective crimes is that the accused were running

establishments named 'Nedumparambil Credit Syndicate'

and 'Nedumparambil Nidhi Limited'. The accused had

offered high interest on fixed deposits to the de-facto

complainants. Accordingly, the de-facto complainants

deposited money in the said establishment on the belief of

getting high interest. However, the accused did not pay

the interest or return the capital. Thus, the accused have

committed the above offences.

B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

69 2024:KER:70789

3. Heard; Sri.Jai George, the learned counsel

appearing for the petitioners; Smt. Seetha S.,

Sri.C.S.Hrithwik, and Smt. Pushpalatha. M.K, the learned

Senior Public Prosecutors.

4. The learned counsel for the petitioners

submitted that the petitioners are totally innocent of the

accusations levelled against them. They have been falsely

implicated in the crime. There is no material to

substantiate that the petitioners have committed the

above offences. In any given case, the petitioners have

been in judicial custody for the last 140 days, the

investigation in the cases is not complete, and the final

reports have not been filed, despite the lapse of 90 days.

Therefore, the petitioners are entitled to be released on

statutory bail in all the crimes, as contemplated under

sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code. By the

common order dated 06.08.2024 in B.A.No.5656/2024

and connected cases, the common order dated

30.08.2024 in B.A.No.7170/2024 and connected cases,
B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

70 2024:KER:70789

the common order dated 09.09.2024 in B.A.No.7300/2024

and connected cases, and the common order dated

11.09.2024 in B.A.No.7615/2024 and connected cases,

this Court has already enlarged the petitioners on bail.

The petitioners are entitled to the benefit of a similar

order. Hence, the applications may be allowed.

5. The learned Public Prosecutors opposed the

applications. They submitted that the petitioners have

committed serious economic offences by cheating the

public at large. There are numerous cases registered

against the petitioners for committing similar offences.

The petitioners are not entitled to statutory bail since

their arrests were recorded in this batch of cases only

from 28.06.2024 to 05.09.2024. Since
Section 409
of the

IPC is incorporated, the petitioners are liable to be

punished with life sentences. Therefore, the time period

to file final reports is up to 90 days, which has not lapsed

in these cases. If the petitioners are enlarged on bail,

there is every likelihood of them committing similar
B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

71 2024:KER:70789

offences. Hence, the applications may be dismissed.

6. The common prosecution case in all the crimes

is that the petitioners had induced the de-facto

complainants to deposit money in their establishments on

the assurance of paying them high interest. However, the

accused failed to pay the interest or return the capital

within the stipulated time period. The fact remains that

the petitioners were arrested in Crime No.644/2024 of

the Thiruvalla Police Station as early as on 07.05.2024.

They have been in judicial custody for the last 140 days.

In one batch of cases, this Court has already enlarged the

petitioners on statutory bail, since the final reports were

not filed within the stipulated time period. The

petitioners are actually entitled to the benefit of statutory

bail since they are languishing in jail from 07.05.2024. It

is only because their arrests were subsequently recorded

in the present crimes, that they are not entitled to

statutory bail as on today. However, the fact remains that

the petitioners have been in judicial custody for the last
B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

72 2024:KER:70789

140 days, the investigation in the cases is practically

complete, and recoveries have been effected.

7. Recently, in
Manish Sisodia v. Directorate of

Enforcement
[2024 INSC 595] the Honourable Supreme

Court has observed that, over a period of time, the trial

courts and the High Courts have forgotten a very well-

settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a

punishment. From its experience, it appears that the trial

courts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in

matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is the rule

and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in

breach. On account of non-grant of bail even in straight

forward open and shut cases, the Honourable Supreme

Court is flooded with huge number of bail petitions

thereby adding to the huge pendency. It is high time that

the trial courts and the High Courts recognize the

principle that "bail is the rule and jail is an exception.

8. Similarly, in
Jalaluddin Khan v Union of

India
[2024 INSC 604] the Hon'ble Supreme Court has
B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

73 2024:KER:70789

observed in the following lines:

"21. xxx xxxx xxx When a case is made out for a
grant of bail, the Courts should not have any hesitation in
granting bail. The allegations of the prosecution may be
very serious. But, the duty of the Courts is to consider the
case for grant of bail in accordance with the law. "Bail is
the rule and jail is an exception" is a settled law. Even in a
case like the present case where there are stringent
conditions for the grant of bail in the relevant statutes, the
same rule holds good with only modification that the bail
can be granted if the conditions in the statute are satisfied.
The rule also means that once a case is made out for the
grant of bail, the Court cannot decline to grant bail. If the
Courts start denying bail in deserving cases, it will be a
violation of the rights guaranteed under
Article 21
of our

Constitution."

9.
In
Satender Kumar Antil v. CBI and

another
[(2022) 10 SCC 51], the Hon'ble Supreme Court,

after a meticulous survey of all the precedents on the law

governing bail, has laid down exhaustive guidelines for

the Courts while dealing with the bail applications. It is

profitable to extract the relevant paragraphs of the

decision in this context of the case on hand, which reads

thus:

"12. The principle that bail is the rule and jail is the
B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

74 2024:KER:70789

exception has been well recognised through the repetitive
pronouncements of this Court. This again is on the touchstone
of
Article 21
of the Constitution of India. This Court in Nikesh
Tarachand Shah v. Union of India [Nikesh Tarachand
Shah v. Union of India, (2018) 11 SCC 1 : (2018) 2 SCC (Cri)
302] , held that : (SCC pp. 22-23 & 27, paras 19 & 24) ."

13. Further this Court in
Sanjay
Chandra v. CBI [Sanjay Chandra
v. CBI, (2012) 1 SCC 40 :

(2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 26 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 397] , has observed
that : (SCC p. 52, paras 21-23)
"21. In bail applications, generally, it has been laid
down from the earliest times that the object of bail is to secure
the appearance of the accused person at his trial by reasonable
amount of bail. The object of bail is neither punitive nor
preventative. Deprivation of liberty must be considered a
punishment, unless it is required to ensure that an accused
person will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe
more than verbal respect to the principle that punishment
begins after conviction, and that every man is deemed to be
innocent until duly tried and duly found guilty.

10.
In
Prabir Purkayastha v. State (NCT of

Delhi
)[2024 SCC OnLine SC 934], the Honourable

Supreme Court has observed as follows:-

"21. The Right to Life and Personal Liberty is the
most sacrosanct fundamental right guaranteed under

Articles 20
, 21
and
of the Constitution of India. Any
attempt to encroach upon this fundamental right has been
frowned upon by this Court in a catena of decisions.
In this
regard, we may refer to following observations made by
this Court in the case of
Roy V.D. v. State of Kerala
[(2022)
SCC OnLine SC 929 : 2022 INSC 756]:--

"7. The life and liberty of an individual is so
sacrosanct that it cannot be allowed to be interfered with
except under the authority of law. It is a principle which
has been recognised and applied in all civilised countries.
In our Constitution
Article 21
guarantees protection of life
and personal liberty not only to citizens of India but also
to aliens."

B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

75 2024:KER:70789

11. On an overall consideration of the facts, the

rival submissions made across the Bar, and the materials

placed on record, particularly on considering the fact that

the petitioners have been in judicial custody for the last

140 days, the investigation in the cases is practically

complete, recoveries have been effected, and the

petitioners have been enlarged on bail in several cases by

this Court, I am of the firm view that the petitioners'

further detention is unnecessary. Hence, I hold that the

petitioners are entitled to be enlarged on bail; but subject

to stringent conditions.

In the result, the applications are allowed, by

directing the petitioners to be released on bail in each

crime, on them executing a bond for Rs.1,00,000/-

(Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for

the like sum, in each of the crimes to the satisfaction of

the courts having jurisdiction, which shall be subject to

the following conditions:

B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

76 2024:KER:70789

(i) The petitioners shall appear before
the Investigating Officers on every fourth Saturday
between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m till the final reports are
laid. They shall also appear before the Investigating
Officers as and when required;

(ii) The petitioners shall not directly or
indirectly make any inducement, threat or procure to
any person acquainted with the facts of the case so
as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the
court or to any Police Officer or tamper with the
evidence in any manner, whatsoever;

(iii) The petitioners shall not commit any
offence while they are on bail;

(iv) In case of violation of any of the
conditions mentioned above, the jurisdictional court
shall be empowered to consider the application for
cancellation of bail, if any filed, and pass orders on
the same, in accordance with law.

(v) Applications for deletion/modification of
the bail conditions shall be moved and entertained by
the court below.

B.A.No.7634 of 2024 & con.cases

77 2024:KER:70789

(vi) Needless to mention, it would be well
within the powers of the Investigating Officer to
investigate the matter and, if necessary, to effect
recoveries on the information, if any, given by the
petitioners even while the petitioners are on bail as

laid down by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Sushila
Aggarwal v. State (NCT of Delhi) and Another

[2020 (1) KHC 663].
